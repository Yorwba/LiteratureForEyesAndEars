5
00:00:16,160 --> 00:00:28,090
Once upon a time—fairy tales always begin with once upon a time—once upon a time there lived in a castle on the Rhine a certain Baron von Schrochslofsleschsfinger.

6
00:00:28,090 --> 00:00:45,030
You will not find it an easy name to pronounce; in fact, the baron never tried it himself but once, and then he was laid up for two days afterwards; so in future we will merely call him "the baron," for shortness, particularly as he was a rather dumpy man.

7
00:00:45,030 --> 00:00:52,410
After having heard his name, you will not be surprised when I tell you that he was an exceedingly bad character.

8
00:00:52,410 --> 00:01:09,490
For a baron, he was considered enormously rich; a hundred and fifty pounds a year would not be thought much in this country; but still it will buy a good deal of sausage, which, with wine grown on the estate, formed the chief sustenance of the baron and his family.

9
00:01:09,490 --> 00:01:24,200
Now, you will hardly believe that, notwithstanding he was the possessor of this princely revenue, the baron was not satisfied, but oppressed and ground down his unfortunate tenants to the very last penny he could possibly squeeze out of them.

10
00:01:24,200 --> 00:01:42,250
In all his exactions he was seconded and encouraged by his steward Klootz, an old rascal who took a malicious pleasure in his master's cruelty, and who chuckled and rubbed his hands with the greatest apparent enjoyment when any of the poor landholders could not pay their rent,

11
00:01:42,250 --> 00:01:46,340
or afforded him any opportunity for oppression.

12
00:01:46,340 --> 00:02:03,000
Not content with making the poor tenants pay double value for the land they rented, the baron was in the habit of going round every now and then to their houses and ordering anything he took a fancy to, from a fat pig to a pretty daughter, to be sent to the castle.

13
00:02:03,000 --> 00:02:14,050
The pretty daughter was made parlor-maid, but as she had nothing a year, and to find herself, it wasn't what would be considered by careful mothers an eligible situation.

14
00:02:14,050 --> 00:02:17,570
The fat pig became sausage, of course.

15
00:02:17,570 --> 00:02:29,660
Things went on from bad to worse, till, at the time of our story, between the alternate squeezings of the baron and his steward, the poor tenants had very little left to squeeze out of them.

16
00:02:29,660 --> 00:02:38,200
The fat pigs and pretty daughters had nearly all found their way up to the castle, and there was little left to take.

17
00:02:38,200 --> 00:02:50,340
The only help the poor fellows had was the baron's only daughter, Lady Bertha, who always had a kind word, and frequently something more substantial, for them when her father was not in the way.

18
00:02:51,620 --> 00:03:00,030
Now, I'm not going to describe Bertha, for the simple reason that if I did you would imagine that she was the fairy I'm going to tell you about, and she isn't.

19
00:03:00,030 --> 00:03:03,560
However, I don't mind giving you a few outlines.

20
00:03:03,560 --> 00:03:18,520
In the first place, she was exceedingly tiny,—the nicest girls, the real lovable little pets, always are tiny,—and she had long silken black hair, and a dear, dimpled little face full of love and mischief.

21
00:03:18,520 --> 00:03:27,340
Now, then, fill up the outline with the details of the nicest and prettiest girl you know, and you will have a slight idea of her.

22
00:03:27,340 --> 00:03:36,430
On second thoughts, I don't believe you will, for your portrait wouldn't be half good enough; however, it will be near enough for you.

23
00:03:36,430 --> 00:03:49,440
Well, the baron's daughter, being all your fancy painted her and a trifle more, was naturally much distressed at the goings-on of her unamiable parent, and tried her best to make amends for her father's harshness.

24
00:03:49,440 --> 00:04:03,130
She generally managed that a good many pounds of the sausage should find their way back to the owners of the original pig; and when the baron tried to squeeze the hand of the pretty parlor-maid, which he occasionally did after dinner,

25
00:04:03,130 --> 00:04:07,330
Bertha had only to say, in a tone of mild remonstrance, "Pa!"

26
00:04:07,330 --> 00:04:12,260
and he dropped the hand instantly and stared very hard the other way.

27
00:04:12,260 --> 00:04:19,130
Bad as this disreputable old baron was, he had a respect for the goodness and purity of his child.

28
00:04:19,130 --> 00:04:34,090
Like the lion tamed by the charm of Una's innocence, the rough old rascal seemed to lose in her presence half of his rudeness, and, though he used awful language to her sometimes (I dare say even Una's lion roared occasionally),

29
00:04:34,090 --> 00:04:39,200
he was more tractable with her than with any other living being.

30
00:04:39,200 --> 00:04:49,610
Her presence operated as a moral restraint upon him, which, possibly, was the reason that he never stayed down-stairs after dinner, but always retired to a favorite turret,

31
00:04:49,610 --> 00:04:58,200
which, I regret to say, he had got so in the way of doing every afternoon that I believe he would have felt unwell without it.

32
00:04:58,200 --> 00:05:05,850
The hour of the baron's afternoon symposium was the time selected by Bertha for her errands of charity.

33
00:05:05,850 --> 00:05:18,060
Once he was fairly settled down to his second bottle, off went Bertha, with her maid beside her carrying a basket, to bestow a meal on some of the poor tenants, among whom she was always received with blessings.

34
00:05:18,060 --> 00:05:30,780
At first these excursions had been undertaken principally from charitable motives, and Bertha thought herself plentifully repaid in the love and thanks of her grateful pensioners.

35
00:05:30,780 --> 00:05:45,200
Of late, however, another cause had led her to take even stronger interest in her walks, and occasionally to come in with brighter eyes and a rosier cheek than the gratitude of the poor tenants had been wont to produce.

36
00:05:45,200 --> 00:06:00,980
The fact is, some months before the time of our story, Bertha had noticed in her walks a young artist, who seemed to be fated to be invariably sketching points of interest in the road she had to take.

37
00:06:00,980 --> 00:06:14,700
There was one particular tree, exactly in the path which led from the castle-gate, which he had sketched from at least four points of view, and Bertha began to wonder what there could be so very particular about it.

38
00:06:16,080 --> 00:06:22,680
At last, just as Carl von Sempach had begun to consider where on earth he could sketch the tree from next,

39
00:06:22,680 --> 00:06:28,420
and to ponder seriously upon the feasibility of climbing up into it and taking it from that point of view,

40
00:06:28,420 --> 00:06:40,170
a trifling accident occurred which gave him the opportunity of making Bertha's acquaintance,—which, I don't mind stating confidentially, was the very thing he had been waiting for.

41
00:06:40,170 --> 00:06:53,810
It so chanced that, on one particular afternoon, the maid, either through awkwardness, or possibly through looking more at the handsome painter than the ground she was walking on, stumbled and fell.

42
00:06:53,810 --> 00:07:03,970
Of course, the basket fell, too, and equally of course, Carl, as a gentleman, could not do less than offer his assistance in picking up the damsel and the dinner.

43
00:07:03,970 --> 00:07:18,180
The acquaintance thus commenced was not suffered to drop; and handsome Carl and our good little Bertha were fairly over head and ears in love, and had begun to have serious thoughts of a cottage in a wood, et cætera,

44
00:07:18,180 --> 00:07:25,700
when their felicity was disturbed by their being accidentally met, in one of their walks, by the baron.

45
00:07:25,700 --> 00:07:36,050
Of course the baron, being himself so thorough an aristocrat, had higher views for his daughter than marrying her to a "beggarly artist," and accordingly he stamped, and swore,

46
00:07:36,050 --> 00:07:46,850
and threatened Carl with summary punishment with all sorts of weapons, from heavy boots to blunderbusses, if ever he ventured near the premises again.

47
00:07:46,850 --> 00:07:55,870
This was unpleasant; but I fear it did not quite put a stop to the young people's interviews, though it made them less frequent and more secret than before.

48
00:07:55,870 --> 00:08:08,120
Now, I am quite aware this was not at all proper, and that no properly regulated young lady would ever have had meetings with a young man her papa didn't approve of.

49
00:08:08,120 --> 00:08:13,720
But then it is just possible Bertha might not have been a properly regulated young lady.

50
00:08:13,720 --> 00:08:21,190
I only know she was a dear little pet, worth twenty model young ladies, and that she loved Carl very dearly.

51
00:08:21,190 --> 00:08:26,340
And then consider what a dreadful old tyrant of a papa she had!

52
00:08:26,340 --> 00:08:41,880
My dear girl, it's not the slightest use your looking so provokingly correct; it's my deliberate belief that if you had been in her shoes (they'd have been at least three sizes too small for you, but that doesn't matter) you would have done precisely the same.

53
00:08:41,880 --> 00:08:47,710
Such was the state of things on Christmas eve in the year——Stay!

54
00:08:47,710 --> 00:08:56,460
fairy tales never have a year to them, so, on second thoughts, I wouldn't tell the date if I knew,—but I don't.

55
00:08:56,460 --> 00:09:06,080
Such was the state of things, however, on the particular 24th of December to which our story refers—only, if anything, rather more so.

56
00:09:06,080 --> 00:09:15,710
The baron had got up in the morning in an exceedingly bad temper; and those about him had felt its effects all through the day.

57
00:09:15,710 --> 00:09:29,880
His two favorite wolf-hounds, Lutzow and Teufel, had received so many kicks from the baron's heavy boots that they hardly knew at which end their tails were; and even Klootz himself scarcely dared to approach his master.

58
00:09:29,880 --> 00:09:39,620
In the middle of the day two of the principal tenants came to say that they were unprepared with their rent, and to beg for a little delay.

59
00:09:39,620 --> 00:09:51,740
The poor fellows represented that their families were starving, and entreated for mercy; but the baron was only too glad that he had at last found so fair an excuse for venting his ill-humor.

60
00:09:51,740 --> 00:09:57,400
He loaded the unhappy defaulters with every abusive epithet he could devise

61
00:09:57,400 --> 00:10:02,290
(and being called names in German is no joke, I can tell you);

62
00:10:02,290 --> 00:10:14,560
and, lastly, he swore by everything he could think of that, if their rent was not paid on the morrow, themselves and their families should be turned out of doors to sleep on the snow, which was then many inches deep on the ground.

63
00:10:14,560 --> 00:10:22,910
They still continued to beg for mercy, till the baron became so exasperated that he determined to put them out of the castle himself.

64
00:10:22,910 --> 00:10:30,510
He pursued them for that purpose as far as the outer door, when fresh fuel was added to his anger.

65
00:10:30,510 --> 00:10:43,880
Carl, who, as I have hinted, still managed, notwithstanding the paternal prohibition, to see Bertha occasionally, and had come to wish her a merry Christmas, chanced at this identical moment to be saying good-bye

66
00:10:43,880 --> 00:10:51,700
at the door, above which, in accordance with immemorial usage, a huge bush of mistletoe was suspended.

67
00:10:51,700 --> 00:10:59,500
What they were doing under it at the moment of the baron's appearance, I never knew exactly; but his wrath was tremendous!

68
00:10:59,500 --> 00:11:04,230
I regret to say that his language was unparliamentary in the extreme.

69
00:11:04,230 --> 00:11:20,100
He swore until he was mauve in the face; and if he had not providentially been seized with a fit of coughing, and sat down in the coal-scuttle,—mistaking it for a three-legged stool,—it is impossible to say to what lengths his feelings might have carried him.

70
00:11:20,100 --> 00:11:26,040
Carl and Bertha picked him up, rather black behind, but otherwise not much the worse for his accident.

71
00:11:26,040 --> 00:11:36,830
In fact, the diversion of his thoughts seemed to have done him good; for, having sworn a little more, and Carl having left the castle, he appeared rather better.

72
00:11:36,830 --> 00:11:55,940
After enduring so many and various emotions, it is hardly to be wondered at that the baron required some consolation; so, after having changed his trousers, he took himself off to his favorite turret to allay, by copious potations, the irritations of his mind.

73
00:11:55,940 --> 00:12:00,960
Bottle after bottle was emptied, and pipe after pipe was filled and smoked.

74
00:12:00,960 --> 00:12:09,310
The fine old Burgundy was gradually getting into the baron's head; and, altogether, he was beginning to feel more comfortable.

75
00:12:09,310 --> 00:12:14,360
The shades of the winter afternoon had deepened into the evening twilight,

76
00:12:14,360 --> 00:12:21,440
made dimmer still by the aromatic clouds that came, with dignified deliberation, from the baron's lips,

77
00:12:21,440 --> 00:12:31,280
and curled and floated up to the carved ceiling of the turret, where they spread themselves into a dim canopy, which every successive cloud brought lower and lower.

78
00:12:31,280 --> 00:12:42,260
The fire, which had been piled up mountain-high earlier in the afternoon, and had flamed and roared to its heart's content ever since, had now got to that state

79
00:12:42,260 --> 00:12:45,020
—the perfection of a fire to a lazy man—

80
00:12:45,020 --> 00:13:01,090
when it requires no poking or attention of any kind, but just burns itself hollow, and then tumbles in, and blazes jovially for a little time, and then settles down to a genial glow, and gets hollow, and tumbles in again.

81
00:13:01,090 --> 00:13:09,310
The baron's fire was just in this delightful da capo condition, most favorable to the enjoyment of the dolce far niente.

82
00:13:09,310 --> 00:13:17,220
For a little while it would glow and kindle quietly, making strange faces to itself,

83
00:13:17,220 --> 00:13:26,060
and building fantastic castles in the depths of its red recesses, and then the castles would come down with a crash, and the faces disappear,

84
00:13:26,060 --> 00:13:35,580
and a bright flame spring up and lick lovingly the sides of the old chimney; and the carved heads of improbable men and impossible women,

85
00:13:35,580 --> 00:13:53,380
hewn so deftly round the panels of the old oak wardrobe opposite, in which the baron's choicest vintages were deposited, were lit up by the flickering light, and seemed to nod and wink at the fire in return, with the familiarity of old acquaintances.

86
00:13:54,380 --> 00:14:11,960
Some such fancy as this was disporting itself in the baron's brain; and he was gazing at the old oak carving accordingly, and emitting huge volumes of smoke with reflective slowness, when a clatter among the bottles on the table caused him to turn his head to ascertain the cause.

87
00:14:11,960 --> 00:14:15,590
The baron was by no means a nervous man;

88
00:14:15,590 --> 00:14:20,780
however, the sight that met his eyes when he turned round did take away his presence of mind a little;

89
00:14:20,780 --> 00:14:29,930
and he was obliged to take four distinct puffs before he had sufficiently regained his equilibrium to inquire, "Who the—Pickwick—are you?"

90
00:14:29,930 --> 00:14:37,290
(The baron said "Dickens," but, as that is a naughty word, we will substitute "Pickwick," which is equally expressive, and not so wrong.)

91
00:14:37,290 --> 00:14:39,750
Let me see; where was I?

92
00:14:39,750 --> 00:14:40,780
Oh, yes!

93
00:14:40,780 --> 00:14:43,080
"Who the Pickwick are you?"

94
00:14:44,200 --> 00:14:51,750
Now, before I allow the baron's visitor to answer the question, perhaps I had better give a slight description of his personal appearance.

95
00:14:51,750 --> 00:15:09,540
If this was not a true story, I should have liked to have made him a model of manly beauty; but a regard for veracity compels me to confess that he was not what would be generally considered handsome; that is, not in figure, for his face was by no means unpleasing.

96
00:15:09,540 --> 00:15:22,070
His body was, in size and shape, not very unlike a huge plum-pudding, and was clothed in a bright-green, tightly-fitting doublet, with red holly-berries for buttons.

97
00:15:22,070 --> 00:15:29,200
His limbs were long and slender in proportion to his stature, which was not more than three feet or so.

98
00:15:29,200 --> 00:15:33,610
His head was encircled by a crown of holly and mistletoe.

99
00:15:33,610 --> 00:15:42,870
The round red berries sparkled amid his hair which was silver-white, and shone out in cheerful harmony with his rosy, jovial face.

100
00:15:42,870 --> 00:15:44,700
And that face!

101
00:15:44,700 --> 00:15:48,530
it would have done one good to look at it.

102
00:15:48,530 --> 00:15:57,430
In spite of the silver hair, and an occasional wrinkle beneath the merry, laughing eyes, it seemed brimming over with perpetual youth.

103
00:15:57,430 --> 00:16:11,950
The mouth, well garnished with teeth, white and sound, which seemed as if they could do ample justice to holiday cheer, was ever open with a beaming, genial smile, expanding now and then into hearty laughter.

104
00:16:11,950 --> 00:16:16,560
Fun and good-fellowship were in every feature.

105
00:16:16,560 --> 00:16:28,040
The owner of the face was, at the moment when the baron first perceived him, comfortably seated upon the top of the large tobacco-jar on the table, nursing his left leg.

106
00:16:28,040 --> 00:16:36,930
The baron's somewhat abrupt inquiry did not appear to irritate him; on the contrary, he seemed rather amused than otherwise.

107
00:16:36,930 --> 00:16:42,230
"You don't ask prettily, old gentleman," he replied; "but I don't mind telling you, for all that.

108
00:16:42,230 --> 00:16:43,860
I'm King Christmas."

109
00:16:43,860 --> 00:16:44,540
"Eh?"

110
00:16:44,540 --> 00:16:45,670
said the baron.

111
00:16:45,670 --> 00:16:46,290
"Ah!"

112
00:16:46,290 --> 00:16:47,410
said the goblin.

113
00:16:47,410 --> 00:16:50,120
Of course, you have guessed he was a goblin?

114
00:16:50,120 --> 00:16:51,610
"And pray what's your business here?"

115
00:16:51,610 --> 00:16:52,640
said the baron.

116
00:16:52,640 --> 00:16:55,800
"Don't be crusty with a fellow," replied the goblin.

117
00:16:55,800 --> 00:16:59,170
"I merely looked in to wish you the compliments of the season.

118
00:16:59,170 --> 00:17:03,940
Talking of crust, by the way, what sort of a tap is it you're drinking?"

119
00:17:03,940 --> 00:17:09,070
So saying, he took up a flask of the baron's very best and poured out about half a glass.

120
00:17:09,070 --> 00:17:25,640
Having held the glass first on one side and then on the other, winked at it twice, sniffed it, and gone through the remainder of the pantomime in which connoisseurs indulge, he drank it with great deliberation, and smacked his lips scientifically.

121
00:17:25,640 --> 00:17:26,330
"Hum!

122
00:17:26,330 --> 00:17:27,390
Johannisberg!

123
00:17:27,390 --> 00:17:28,810
and not so very bad—for you.

124
00:17:28,810 --> 00:17:35,020
But I tell you what it is, baron, you'll have to bring out better stuff than this when I put my legs on your mahogany."

125
00:17:35,020 --> 00:17:37,810
"Well now, you are a cool fish," said the baron.

126
00:17:37,810 --> 00:17:43,330
"However, you're rather a joke, so, now you're here, we may as well enjoy ourselves.

127
00:17:43,330 --> 00:17:44,800
Smoke?"

128
00:17:44,800 --> 00:17:46,850
"Not anything you're likely to offer me!"

129
00:17:46,850 --> 00:17:48,690
"Confound your impudence!"

130
00:17:48,690 --> 00:17:51,860
roared the baron, with a horribly complicated oath.

131
00:17:51,860 --> 00:17:55,920
"That tobacco is as good as any in all Rhineland."

132
00:17:55,920 --> 00:17:57,890
"That's a nasty cough you've got, baron.

133
00:17:57,890 --> 00:18:03,110
Don't excite yourself, my dear boy; I dare say you speak according to your lights.

134
00:18:03,110 --> 00:18:08,400
I don't mean Vesuvians, you know, but your opportunities for knowing anything about it.

135
00:18:08,400 --> 00:18:12,960
Try a weed out of my case, and I expect you'll alter your opinion."

136
00:18:12,960 --> 00:18:16,660
The baron took the proffered case and selected a cigar.

137
00:18:16,660 --> 00:18:33,220
Not a word was spoken till it was half consumed, when the baron took it, for the first time, from his lips, and said, gently, with the air of a man communicating an important discovery in the strictest confidence, "Das ist gut!"

138
00:18:33,220 --> 00:18:35,820
"Thought you'd say so," said the visitor.

139
00:18:35,820 --> 00:18:41,820
"And now, as you like the cigar, I should like you to try a thimbleful of what I call wine.

140
00:18:41,820 --> 00:18:48,540
I must warn you, though, that it is rather potent, and may produce effects you are not accustomed to."

141
00:18:48,540 --> 00:18:55,650
"Bother that, if it is as good as the weed," said the baron; "I haven't taken my usual quantity by four bottles yet."

142
00:18:55,650 --> 00:18:58,590
"Well, don't say I didn't warn you, that's all.

143
00:18:58,590 --> 00:19:04,460
I don't think you'll find it unpleasant, though it is rather strong when you're not accustomed to it."

144
00:19:04,460 --> 00:19:13,360
So saying, the goblin produced from some mysterious pocket a black, big-bellied bottle, crusted, apparently, with the dust of ages.

145
00:19:13,360 --> 00:19:24,020
It did strike the baron as peculiar, that the bottle, when once produced, appeared nearly as big round as the goblin himself; but he was not the sort of man to stick at trifles,

146
00:19:24,020 --> 00:19:33,160
and he pushed forward his glass to be filled just as composedly as if the potion had been shipped and paid duty, in the most commonplace way.

147
00:19:33,160 --> 00:19:38,320
The glass was filled and emptied, but the baron uttered not his opinion.

148
00:19:38,320 --> 00:19:44,890
Not in words, at least, but he pushed forward his glass to be filled again in a manner that sufficiently bespoke his approval.

149
00:19:44,890 --> 00:19:45,910
"Aha!

150
00:19:45,910 --> 00:19:46,550
you smile!"

151
00:19:46,550 --> 00:19:47,160
said the goblin.

152
00:19:47,160 --> 00:19:54,970
And it was a positive fact; the baron was smiling; a thing he had not been known to do in the memory of the oldest inhabitant.

153
00:19:54,970 --> 00:19:57,530
"That's the stuff to make your hair curl, isn't it?"

154
00:19:57,530 --> 00:19:59,740
"I believe you, my boy!"

155
00:19:59,740 --> 00:20:06,690
The baron brought out this earnest expression of implicit confidence with true unction.

156
00:20:06,690 --> 00:20:09,270
"It warms one here!"

157
00:20:09,270 --> 00:20:15,460
Knowing the character of the man, one would have expected him to put his hand upon his stomach.

158
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:18,750
But he didn't; he laid it upon his heart.

159
00:20:18,750 --> 00:20:22,940
"The spell begins to operate, I see," said the goblin.

160
00:20:22,940 --> 00:20:24,570
"Have another glass?"

161
00:20:24,570 --> 00:20:29,250
The baron had another glass, and another after that.

162
00:20:29,250 --> 00:20:40,490
The smile on his face expanded into an expression of such geniality that the whole character of his countenance was changed, and his own mother wouldn't have known him.

163
00:20:40,490 --> 00:20:57,320
I doubt myself—inasmuch as she died when he was exactly a year and three months old—whether she would have recognized him under any circumstances; but I merely wish to express that he was changed almost beyond recognition.

164
00:20:57,320 --> 00:21:04,250
"Upon my word," said the baron, at length, "I feel so light I almost think I could dance a hornpipe.

165
00:21:04,250 --> 00:21:05,770
I used to, once, I know.

166
00:21:05,770 --> 00:21:07,620
Shall I try?"

167
00:21:08,700 --> 00:21:13,620
"Well, if you ask my advice," replied the goblin, "I should say, decidedly, don't.

168
00:21:13,620 --> 00:21:19,750
'Barkis is willing,' I dare say, but trousers are weak, and you might split 'em."

169
00:21:19,750 --> 00:21:22,530
"Hang it all," said the baron, "so I might.

170
00:21:22,530 --> 00:21:24,610
I didn't think of that.

171
00:21:24,610 --> 00:21:28,330
But still I feel as if I must do something juvenile!"

172
00:21:28,330 --> 00:21:29,590
"Ah!

173
00:21:29,590 --> 00:21:32,750
that's the effect of your change of nature," said the goblin.

174
00:21:32,750 --> 00:21:36,560
"Never mind, I'll give you plenty to do presently."

175
00:21:36,560 --> 00:21:37,790
"Change of nature!

176
00:21:37,790 --> 00:21:39,590
What do you mean, you old conundrum?"

177
00:21:39,590 --> 00:21:40,770
said the baron.

178
00:21:40,770 --> 00:21:43,220
"You're another," said the goblin.

179
00:21:43,220 --> 00:21:44,450
"But never mind.

180
00:21:44,450 --> 00:21:47,130
What I mean is just this.

181
00:21:47,130 --> 00:21:53,110
What you are now feeling is the natural consequence of my magic wine, which has changed you into a fairy.

182
00:21:53,110 --> 00:21:55,570
That's what's the matter, sir."

183
00:21:55,570 --> 00:21:56,450
"A fairy!

184
00:21:56,450 --> 00:21:56,860
me!"

185
00:21:56,860 --> 00:21:58,020
exclaimed the baron.

186
00:21:58,020 --> 00:21:58,750
"Get out.

187
00:21:58,750 --> 00:22:00,880
I'm too fat."

188
00:22:00,880 --> 00:22:01,390
"Fat!

189
00:22:01,390 --> 00:22:01,610
Oh!

190
00:22:01,610 --> 00:22:02,370
that's nothing.

191
00:22:02,370 --> 00:22:08,630
We shall put you in regular training, and you'll soon be slim enough to creep into a lady's stocking.

192
00:22:08,630 --> 00:22:15,160
Not that you'll be called upon to do anything of the sort; but I'm merely giving you an idea of your future figure."

193
00:22:15,160 --> 00:22:17,780
"No, no," said the baron; "me thin!

194
00:22:17,780 --> 00:22:19,200
that's too ridiculous.

195
00:22:19,200 --> 00:22:21,500
Why, that's worse than being a fairy.

196
00:22:21,500 --> 00:22:23,190
You don't mean it, though, do you?

197
00:22:23,190 --> 00:22:25,480
I do feel rather peculiar."

198
00:22:25,480 --> 00:22:27,850
"I do, indeed," said the visitor.

199
00:22:27,850 --> 00:22:29,770
"You don't dislike it, do you?"

200
00:22:29,770 --> 00:22:32,800
"Well, no, I can't say I do, entirely.

201
00:22:32,800 --> 00:22:36,430
It's queer, though, I feel so uncommon friendly.

202
00:22:36,430 --> 00:22:41,140
I feel as if I should like to shake hands or pat somebody on the back."

203
00:22:41,140 --> 00:22:41,540
"Ah!"

204
00:22:41,540 --> 00:22:43,410
said the goblin, "I know how it is.

205
00:22:43,410 --> 00:22:46,390
Rum feeling, when you're not accustomed to it.

206
00:22:46,390 --> 00:22:49,090
But come; finish that glass, for we must be off.

207
00:22:49,090 --> 00:22:52,840
We've got a precious deal to do before morning, I can tell you.

208
00:22:52,840 --> 00:22:54,620
Are you ready?"

209
00:22:54,620 --> 00:22:56,050
"All right," said the baron.

210
00:22:56,050 --> 00:22:59,620
"I'm just in the humor to make a night of it."

211
00:22:59,620 --> 00:23:02,370
"Come along, then," said the goblin.

212
00:23:02,370 --> 00:23:06,800
They proceeded for a short time in silence along the corridors of the old castle.

213
00:23:06,800 --> 00:23:17,360
They carried no candle, but the baron noticed that everything seemed perfectly light wherever they stood, but relapsed into darkness as soon as they had passed by.

214
00:23:17,360 --> 00:23:19,810
The goblin spoke first.

215
00:23:19,810 --> 00:23:24,860
"I say, baron, you've been an uncommon old brute in your time, now, haven't you?"

216
00:23:24,860 --> 00:23:28,860
"H'm," said the baron, reflectively; "I don't know.

217
00:23:28,860 --> 00:23:31,400
Well, yes, I rather think I have."

218
00:23:31,400 --> 00:23:36,210
"How jolly miserable you've been making those two young people, you old sinner!

219
00:23:36,210 --> 00:23:37,660
You know who I mean."

220
00:23:37,660 --> 00:23:39,160
"Eh, what?

221
00:23:39,160 --> 00:23:40,290
You know that, too?"

222
00:23:40,290 --> 00:23:41,480
said the baron.

223
00:23:41,480 --> 00:23:43,370
"Know it; of course I do.

224
00:23:43,370 --> 00:23:45,720
Why, bless your heart, I know everything, my dear boy.

225
00:23:45,720 --> 00:23:51,330
But you have made yourself an old tyrant in that quarter, considerably.

226
00:23:51,330 --> 00:23:54,780
Ar'n't you blushing, you hard-hearted old monster?"

227
00:23:54,780 --> 00:23:59,960
"Don't know, I'm sure," said the baron, scratching his nose, as if that was where he expected to feel it.

228
00:23:59,960 --> 00:24:06,030
"I believe I have treated them badly, though, now I come to think of it."

229
00:24:06,030 --> 00:24:12,340
At this moment they reached the door of Bertha's chamber The door opened of itself at their approach.

230
00:24:12,340 --> 00:24:15,050
"Come along," said the goblin; "you won't wake her.

231
00:24:15,050 --> 00:24:17,160
Now, old flinty-heart, look there."

232
00:24:17,160 --> 00:24:23,820
The sight that met the baron's view was one that few fathers could have beheld without affectionate emotion.

233
00:24:23,820 --> 00:24:35,350
Under ordinary circumstances, however, the baron would not have felt at all sentimental on the subject, but tonight something made him view things in quite a different light.

234
00:24:35,350 --> 00:24:41,590
I shouldn't like to make affidavit of the fact, but it's my positive impression that he sighed.

235
00:24:41,590 --> 00:24:50,980
Now, my dear reader, don't imagine I'm going to indulge your impertinent curiosity with an elaborate description of the sacred details of a lady's sleeping apartment.

236
00:24:50,980 --> 00:25:04,240
You're not a fairy, you know, and I don't see that it can possibly matter to you whether fair Bertha's dainty little bottines were tidily placed on a chair by her bedside, or thrown carelessly, as they had been taken off, upon the hearth-rug,

237
00:25:04,240 --> 00:25:19,810
where her favorite spaniel reposed, warming his nose in his sleep before the last smouldering embers of the decaying fire; or whether her crinoline—but if she did wear a crinoline, what can that possibly matter to you?

238
00:25:19,810 --> 00:25:28,620
All I shall tell you is, that everything looked snug and comfortable; but, somehow, any place got that look when Bertha was in it.

239
00:25:28,620 --> 00:25:33,460
And now a word about the jewel in the casket—pet Bertha herself.

240
00:25:33,460 --> 00:25:36,670
Really, I'm at a loss to describe her.

241
00:25:36,670 --> 00:25:41,100
How do you look when you're asleep?—Well, it wasn't like that; not a bit!

242
00:25:41,100 --> 00:25:59,540
Fancy a sweet girl's face, the cheek faintly flushed with a soft, warm tint, like the blush in the heart of the opening rose, and made brighter by the contrast of the snowy pillow on which it rested; dark silken hair, curling and clustering lovingly over the tiniest of tiny ears,

243
00:25:59,540 --> 00:26:10,060
and the softest, whitest neck that ever mortal maiden was blessed with; long silken eyelashes, fringing lids only less beautiful than the dear earnest eyes they cover.

244
00:26:10,060 --> 00:26:24,750
Fancy all this, and fancy, too, if you can, the expression of perfect goodness and purity that lit up the sweet features of the slumbering maiden with a beauty almost angelic, and you will see what the baron saw that night.

245
00:26:24,750 --> 00:26:42,570
Not quite all, however, for the baron's vision paused not at the bedside before him, but had passed on from the face of the sleeping maiden to another face as lovely, that of the young wife, Bertha's mother, who had, years before, taken her angel beauty to the angels.

246
00:26:42,570 --> 00:26:45,850
The goblin spoke to the baron's thought.

247
00:26:45,850 --> 00:26:48,130
"Wonderfully like her, is she not, baron?"

248
00:26:48,130 --> 00:26:51,480
The baron slowly inclined his head.

249
00:26:51,480 --> 00:26:55,170
"You made her happy, didn't you?"

250
00:26:55,170 --> 00:26:59,100
The tone in which the goblin spoke was harsh and mocking.

251
00:26:59,100 --> 00:27:01,120
"A faithful husband, tender and true!

252
00:27:01,120 --> 00:27:04,040
She must have been a happy wife, eh, baron?"

253
00:27:04,040 --> 00:27:08,510
The baron's head had sunk upon his bosom.

254
00:27:08,510 --> 00:27:12,550
Old recollections were thronging into his awakened memory.

255
00:27:12,550 --> 00:27:16,830
Solemn vows to love and cherish somewhat strangely kept.

256
00:27:16,830 --> 00:27:24,930
Memories of bitter words and savage oaths showered at a quiet and uncomplaining figure, without one word in reply.

257
00:27:24,930 --> 00:27:32,530
And at last, the memory of a fit of drunken passion, and a hasty blow struck with a heavy hand.

258
00:27:32,530 --> 00:27:41,030
And then of three months of fading away; and last, of her last prayer—for her baby and him.

259
00:27:41,030 --> 00:27:44,440
"A good husband makes a good father, baron.

260
00:27:44,440 --> 00:27:50,220
No wonder you are somewhat chary of rashly intrusting to a suitor the happiness of a sweet flower like this.

261
00:27:50,220 --> 00:27:50,810
Poor girl!

262
00:27:50,810 --> 00:27:57,460
It is hard, though, that she must think no more of him she loves so dearly.

263
00:27:57,460 --> 00:27:58,330
See!

264
00:27:58,330 --> 00:28:00,400
she is weeping even in her dreams.

265
00:28:00,400 --> 00:28:03,240
But you have good reasons, no doubt.

266
00:28:03,240 --> 00:28:06,890
Young Carl is wild, perhaps, or drinks, or gambles, eh?

267
00:28:06,890 --> 00:28:07,640
What!

268
00:28:07,640 --> 00:28:08,710
none of these?

269
00:28:08,710 --> 00:28:16,560
Perhaps he is wayward and uncertain; and you fear that the honeyed words of courtship might turn to bitter sayings in matrimony.

270
00:28:16,560 --> 00:28:18,730
They do, sometimes, eh, baron?

271
00:28:18,730 --> 00:28:22,570
By all means guard her from such a fate as that.

272
00:28:22,570 --> 00:28:23,640
Poor, tender flower!

273
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,760
Or who knows, worse than that, baron!

274
00:28:26,760 --> 00:28:33,360
Hard words break no bones, they say, but angry men are quick, and a blow is soon struck, eh?"

275
00:28:33,360 --> 00:28:42,810
The goblin had drawn nearer and nearer, and laid his hand upon the baron's arm, and the last words were literally hissed into his ears.

276
00:28:42,810 --> 00:28:49,670
The baron's frame swayed to and fro under the violence of his emotion.

277
00:28:49,670 --> 00:28:54,600
At last, with a cry of agony, he dashed his hands upon his forehead.

278
00:28:54,600 --> 00:29:01,380
The veins were swollen up like thick cords, and his voice was almost inarticulate in its unnatural hoarseness.

279
00:29:01,380 --> 00:29:02,760
"Tortures!

280
00:29:02,760 --> 00:29:03,570
release me!

281
00:29:03,570 --> 00:29:10,100
Let me go, let me go and do something to forget the past, or I shall go mad and die!"

282
00:29:10,100 --> 00:29:17,680
He rushed out of the room and paced wildly down the corridor, the goblin following him.

283
00:29:17,680 --> 00:29:24,910
At last, as they came near the outer door of the castle, which opened of itself as they reached it, the spirit spoke:

284
00:29:24,910 --> 00:29:26,900
"This way, baron, this way.

285
00:29:26,900 --> 00:29:30,350
I told you there was work for us to do before morning, you know."

286
00:29:30,350 --> 00:29:31,310
"Work!"

287
00:29:31,310 --> 00:29:36,690
exclaimed the baron, absently, passing his fingers through his tangled hair; "oh!

288
00:29:36,690 --> 00:29:37,960
yes, work!

289
00:29:37,960 --> 00:29:42,140
the harder the better; anything to make me forget."

290
00:29:42,140 --> 00:29:51,550
The two stepped out into the court-yard, and the baron shivered, though, as it seemed, unconsciously, at the breath of the frosty midnight air.

291
00:29:51,550 --> 00:29:58,610
The snow lay deep on the ground, and the baron's heavy boots sank into it with a crisp, crushing sound at every tread.

292
00:29:58,610 --> 00:30:07,860
He was bareheaded, but seemed unconscious of the fact, and tramped on, as if utterly indifferent to anything but his own thoughts.

293
00:30:07,860 --> 00:30:16,260
At last, as a blast of the night wind, keener than ordinary, swept over him, he seemed for the first time to feel the chill.

294
00:30:16,260 --> 00:30:21,210
His teeth chattered, and he muttered, "Cold, very cold."

295
00:30:21,210 --> 00:30:28,170
"Ay, baron," said the goblin, "it is cold even to us, who are healthy and strong, and warmed with wine.

296
00:30:28,170 --> 00:30:34,010
Colder still, though, to those who are hungry and half-naked, and have to sleep on the snow."

297
00:30:34,010 --> 00:30:34,910
"Sleep?

298
00:30:34,910 --> 00:30:35,580
snow?"

299
00:30:35,580 --> 00:30:36,710
said the baron.

300
00:30:36,710 --> 00:30:37,900
"Who sleeps on the snow?

301
00:30:37,900 --> 00:30:42,260
Why, I wouldn't let my dogs be out on such a night as this."

302
00:30:42,260 --> 00:30:44,290
"Your dogs, no!"

303
00:30:44,290 --> 00:30:48,450
said the goblin; "I spoke of meaner animals—your wretched tenants.

304
00:30:48,450 --> 00:30:56,260
Did you not order, yesterday, that Wilhelm and Friedrich, if they did not pay their rent tomorrow, should be turned out to sleep on the snow?

305
00:30:56,260 --> 00:31:00,860
A snug bed for the little ones, and a nice white coverlet, eh?

306
00:31:00,860 --> 00:31:01,590
Ha!

307
00:31:01,590 --> 00:31:01,980
ha!

308
00:31:01,980 --> 00:31:04,630
twenty florins or so is no great matter, is it?

309
00:31:04,630 --> 00:31:08,890
I'm afraid their chance is small; nevertheless, come and see."

310
00:31:08,890 --> 00:31:10,990
The baron hung his head.

311
00:31:10,990 --> 00:31:16,100
A few minutes brought him to the first of the poor dwellings, which they entered noiselessly.

312
00:31:16,100 --> 00:31:26,150
The fireless grate, the carpetless floor, the broken window-panes, all gave sufficient testimony to the want and misery of the occupants.

313
00:31:26,150 --> 00:31:35,260
In one corner lay sleeping a man, a woman, and three children, and nestling to each other for the warmth which their ragged coverlet could afford.

314
00:31:35,260 --> 00:31:43,850
In the man, the baron recognized his tenant Wilhelm, one of those who had been with him to beg for indulgence on the previous day.

315
00:31:43,850 --> 00:31:53,450
The keen features, and bones almost starting through the pallid skin, showed how heavily the hand of hunger had been laid upon all.

316
00:31:53,450 --> 00:32:05,120
The cold night wind moaned and whistled through the many flaws in the ill-glazed, ill-thatched tenement, and rustled over the sleepers, who shivered even in their sleep.

317
00:32:05,120 --> 00:32:05,890
"Ha, baron!"

318
00:32:05,890 --> 00:32:13,920
said the goblin, "death is breathing in their faces even now, you see; it is hardly worth while to lay them to sleep in the snow, is it?

319
00:32:13,920 --> 00:32:16,940
They would sleep a little sounder, that's all."

320
00:32:16,940 --> 00:32:24,480
The baron shuddered, and then, hastily pulling the warm coat from his own shoulders, he spread it over the sleepers.

321
00:32:24,480 --> 00:32:25,150
"Oho!"

322
00:32:25,150 --> 00:32:27,690
said the goblin; "bravely done, baron!

323
00:32:27,690 --> 00:32:33,680
By all means keep them warm tonight; they enjoy the snow more tomorrow, you know."

324
00:32:33,680 --> 00:32:44,070
Strange to say, the baron, instead of feeling chilled when he had removed his coat, felt a strange glow of warmth spread from the region of the heart over his entire frame.

325
00:32:44,070 --> 00:32:55,780
The goblin's continual allusions to his former intention, which he had by this time totally relinquished, hurt him, and he said, rather pathetically,—

326
00:32:55,780 --> 00:32:57,940
"Don't talk of that again, good goblin.

327
00:32:57,940 --> 00:33:00,290
I'd rather sleep on the snow myself."

328
00:33:00,290 --> 00:33:01,000
"Eh!

329
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:01,720
what?"

330
00:33:01,720 --> 00:33:05,090
said the goblin; "you don't mean to say you're sorry?

331
00:33:05,090 --> 00:33:09,530
Then what do you say to making these poor people comfortable?"

332
00:33:09,530 --> 00:33:13,440
"With all my heart," said the baron, "if we had only anything to do it with."

333
00:33:13,440 --> 00:33:16,200
"You leave that to me," said the goblin.

334
00:33:16,200 --> 00:33:19,390
"Your brother fairies are not far off, you may be sure."

335
00:33:19,390 --> 00:33:33,270
As he spoke he clapped his hands thrice, and before the third clap had died away the poor cottage was swarming with tiny figures, whom the baron rightly conjectured to be the fairies themselves.

336
00:33:33,270 --> 00:33:42,640
Now, you may not be aware (the baron was not, until that night) that there are among the fairies trades and professions, just as with ordinary mortals.

337
00:33:42,640 --> 00:33:50,960
However, there they were, each with the accompaniments of his or her particular business, and to it they went manfully.

338
00:33:50,960 --> 00:34:08,630
A fairy glazier put in new panes to the shattered windows, fairy carpenters replaced the doors upon their hinges, and fairy painters, with inconceivable celerity, made cupboards and closets as fresh as paint could make them; one fairy housemaid laid and lit a roaring fire,

339
00:34:08,630 --> 00:34:14,490
while another dusted and rubbed chairs and tables to a miraculous degree of brightness;

340
00:34:14,490 --> 00:34:22,310
a fairy butler uncorked bottles of fairy wine, and a fairy cook laid out a repast of most tempting appearance.

341
00:34:22,310 --> 00:34:37,960
The baron, hearing a tapping above him, cast his eyes upward, and beheld a fairy slater rapidly repairing a hole in the roof; and when he bent them down again they fell on a fairy doctor mixing a cordial for the sleepers.

342
00:34:37,960 --> 00:34:51,310
Nay, there was even a fairy parson, who, not having any present employment, contented himself with rubbing his hands and looking pleasant, probably waiting till somebody might want to be christened or married.

343
00:34:51,310 --> 00:35:06,630
Every trade, every profession or occupation appeared, without exception, to be represented; nay, we beg pardon, with one exception only, for the baron used to say, when afterwards relating his experiences to bachelor friends,—

344
00:35:06,630 --> 00:35:14,560
"You may believe me or not, sir, there was every mortal business under the sun, but deil a bit of a lawyer."

345
00:35:14,560 --> 00:35:17,660
The baron could not long remain inactive.

346
00:35:17,660 --> 00:35:27,280
He was rapidly seized with a violent desire to do something to help, which manifested itself in insane attempts to assist everybody at once.

347
00:35:27,280 --> 00:35:43,600
At last, after having taken all the skin off his knuckles in attempting to hammer in nails in aid of the carpenter, and then nearly tumbling over a fairy housemaid, whose broom he was offering to carry, he gave it up as a bad job, and stood aside with his friend the goblin.

348
00:35:43,600 --> 00:35:50,830
He was just about to inquire how it was that the poor occupants of the house were not awakened by so much din,

349
00:35:50,830 --> 00:36:03,180
when a fairy Sam Slick, who had been examining the cottager's old clock with a view to a thorough repair, touched some spring within it, and it made the usual purr preparatory to striking.

350
00:36:03,180 --> 00:36:04,070
When, lo!

351
00:36:04,070 --> 00:36:18,560
and behold, at the very first stroke, cottage, goblin, fairies, and all disappeared into utter darkness, and the baron found himself in his turret-chamber, rubbing his toe, which he had just hit with considerable force against the fender.

352
00:36:18,560 --> 00:36:25,360
As he was only in his slippers, the concussion was unpleasant, and the baron rubbed his toe for a good while.

353
00:36:25,360 --> 00:36:35,490
After he had finished with his toe he rubbed his nose, and, finally, with a countenance of deep reflection, scratched the bump of something or other at the top of his head.

354
00:36:35,490 --> 00:36:39,810
The old clock on the stairs was striking three, and the fire had gone out.

355
00:36:39,810 --> 00:36:49,270
The baron reflected for a short time longer, and finally decided that he had better go to bed, which he did accordingly.

356
00:36:49,270 --> 00:36:54,610
The morning dawned upon the very ideal, as far as weather was concerned, of a Christmas-day.

357
00:36:54,610 --> 00:37:01,740
A bright winter sun shone out just vividly enough to make everything look genial and pleasant,

358
00:37:01,740 --> 00:37:08,160
and yet not with sufficient warmth to mar the pure, unbroken surface of the crisp, white snow,

359
00:37:08,160 --> 00:37:18,440
which lay like a never-ending white lawn upon the ground, and glittered in myriad silver flakes upon the leaves of the sturdy evergreens.

360
00:37:18,440 --> 00:37:26,480
I am afraid the baron had not had a very good night; at any rate, I know that he was wide-awake at an hour long before his usual time of rising.

361
00:37:26,480 --> 00:37:39,930
He lay first on one side, and then on the other, and then, by way of variety, turned on his back, with his magenta nose pointing perpendicularly towards the ceiling; but it was all of no use.

362
00:37:39,930 --> 00:37:49,640
Do what he would, he couldn't get to sleep, and at last, not long after daybreak, he tumbled out of bed and proceeded to dress.

363
00:37:49,640 --> 00:37:54,620
Even after he was out of bed his fidgetiness continued.

364
00:37:54,620 --> 00:38:08,130
It did not strike him, until after he had got one boot on, that it would be a more natural proceeding to put his stockings on first; after which he caught himself in the act of trying to put his trousers on over his head.

365
00:38:08,130 --> 00:38:19,590
In a word, the baron's mind was evidently preoccupied; his whole air was that of a man who felt a strong impulse to do something or other, but could not quite make up his mind to it.

366
00:38:19,590 --> 00:38:30,960
At last, however, the good impulse conquered, and this wicked old baron, in the stillness of the calm, bright Christmas morning, went down upon his knees and prayed.

367
00:38:30,960 --> 00:38:42,010
Stiff were his knees and slow his tongue, for neither had done such work for many a long day past; but I have read in the Book of the joy of angels over a repenting sinner.

368
00:38:42,010 --> 00:38:52,250
There needs not much eloquence to pray the publican's prayer, and who shall say but there was gladness in heaven that Christmas morning?

369
00:38:52,250 --> 00:38:58,080
The baron's appearance down-stairs at such an early hour occasioned quite a commotion.

370
00:38:58,080 --> 00:39:14,120
Nor were the domestics reassured when the baron ordered a bullock to be killed and jointed instantly, and all the available provisions in the larder, including sausage, to be packed up in baskets, with a good store of his own peculiar wine.

371
00:39:14,120 --> 00:39:21,490
One ancient retainer was heard to declare, with much pathos, that he feared master had gone insane.

372
00:39:21,490 --> 00:39:37,380
However, insane or not, they knew the baron must be obeyed, and in an exceedingly short space of time he sallied forth, accompanied by three servants carrying the baskets, and wondering what in the name of fortune their master would do next.

373
00:39:37,380 --> 00:39:44,270
He stopped at the cottage of Wilhelm, which he had visited with the goblin on the previous night.

374
00:39:44,270 --> 00:39:53,620
The labors of the fairies did not seem to have produced much lasting benefit, for the appearance of everything around was as wretched as could be.

375
00:39:53,620 --> 00:40:06,310
The poor family thought that the baron had come himself to turn them out of house and home; and the children huddled up timidly to their mother for protection, while the father attempted some words of entreaty for mercy.

376
00:40:06,310 --> 00:40:13,350
The pale, pinched features of the group, and their looks of dread and wretchedness, were too much for the baron.

377
00:40:13,350 --> 00:40:14,110
"Eh!

378
00:40:14,110 --> 00:40:14,390
what!

379
00:40:14,390 --> 00:40:16,410
what do you mean, confound you?

380
00:40:16,410 --> 00:40:17,420
Turn you out?

381
00:40:17,420 --> 00:40:20,100
Of course not: I've brought you some breakfast.

382
00:40:20,100 --> 00:40:20,520
Here!

383
00:40:20,520 --> 00:40:22,440
Fritz—Carl; where are the knaves?

384
00:40:22,440 --> 00:40:25,190
Now, then, unpack, and don't be a week about it.

385
00:40:25,190 --> 00:40:27,630
Can't you see the people are hungry, ye villains?

386
00:40:27,630 --> 00:40:29,810
Here, lend me the corkscrew."

387
00:40:29,810 --> 00:40:37,210
This last being a tool the baron was tolerably accustomed to, he had better success than with those of the fairy carpenters;

388
00:40:37,210 --> 00:40:47,780
and it was not long before the poor tenants were seated before a roaring fire, and doing justice, with the appetite of starvation, to a substantial breakfast.

389
00:40:47,780 --> 00:40:57,920
The baron felt a queer sensation in his throat at the sight of the poor people's enjoyment, and had passed the back of his hand twice across his eyes when he thought no one was looking;

390
00:40:57,920 --> 00:41:13,060
but his emotion fairly rose to boiling when the poor father, Wilhelm, with tears in his eyes, and about a quarter of a pound of beef in his mouth, sprang up from the table and flung himself at the baron's knees, invoking blessings on him for his goodness.

391
00:41:13,060 --> 00:41:16,310
"Get up, you audacious scoundrel!"

392
00:41:16,310 --> 00:41:17,350
roared the baron.

393
00:41:17,350 --> 00:41:19,890
"What the deuce do you mean by such conduct, eh?

394
00:41:19,890 --> 00:41:21,340
confound you!"

395
00:41:21,340 --> 00:41:31,120
At this moment the door opened, and in walked Mynheer Klootz, who had heard nothing of the baron's change of intentions, and who, seeing Wilhelm at the baron's feet,

396
00:41:31,120 --> 00:41:40,050
and hearing the latter speaking, as he thought, in an angry tone, at once jumped to the conclusion that Wilhelm was entreating for longer indulgence.

397
00:41:40,050 --> 00:41:43,050
He rushed at the unfortunate man and collared him.

398
00:41:43,050 --> 00:41:47,410
"Not if we know it," exclaimed he; "you'll have the wolves for bedfellows tonight, I reckon.

399
00:41:47,410 --> 00:41:49,700
Come along, my fine fellow."

400
00:41:49,700 --> 00:41:56,830
As he spoke he turned his back towards the baron, with the intention of dragging his victim to the door.

401
00:41:56,830 --> 00:42:08,020
The baron's little gray eyes twinkled, and his whole frame quivered with suppressed emotion, which, after the lapse of a moment, vented itself in a kick, and such a kick!

402
00:42:08,020 --> 00:42:19,430
Not one of your Varsovianna flourishes, but a kick that employed every muscle from hip to toe, and drove the worthy steward up against the door like a ball from a catapult.

403
00:42:19,430 --> 00:42:33,400
Misfortunes never come singly, and so Mynheer Klootz found with regard to the kick, for it was followed, without loss of time, by several dozen others, as like it as possible, from the baron's heavy boots.

404
00:42:33,400 --> 00:42:45,620
Wounded lions proverbially come badly off, and Fritz and Carl, who had suffered from many an act of petty tyranny on the part of the steward, thought they could not do better than follow their master's example,

405
00:42:45,620 --> 00:42:55,770
which they did to such good purpose, that when the unfortunate Klootz did escape from the cottage at last, I don't believe he could have had any os sacrum left.

406
00:42:55,770 --> 00:43:09,460
After having executed this little act of poetical justice, the baron and his servants visited the other cottages, in all of which they were received with dread and dismissed with blessings.

407
00:43:09,460 --> 00:43:19,390
Having completed his tour of charity, the baron returned home to breakfast, feeling more really contented than he had done for many a long year.

408
00:43:19,390 --> 00:43:28,890
He found Bertha, who had not risen when he started, in a considerable state of anxiety as to what he could possibly have been doing.

409
00:43:28,890 --> 00:43:35,450
In answer to her inquiries, he told her, with a roughness he was far from feeling, to "mind her own affairs."

410
00:43:35,450 --> 00:43:49,150
The gentle eyes filled with tears at the harshness of the reply; perceiving which, the baron was beyond measure distressed, and chucked her under the chin in what was meant to be a very conciliatory manner.

411
00:43:49,150 --> 00:43:49,900
"Eh!

412
00:43:49,900 --> 00:43:51,700
what, my pretty, tears?

413
00:43:51,700 --> 00:43:52,540
No, surely.

414
00:43:52,540 --> 00:43:54,840
Bertha must forgive her old father.

415
00:43:54,840 --> 00:44:00,600
I didn't mean it, you know, my pet; and yet, on second thoughts, yes, I did, too."

416
00:44:00,600 --> 00:44:03,090
Bertha's face was overcast again.

417
00:44:03,090 --> 00:44:05,950
"My little girl thinks she has no business anywhere, eh!

418
00:44:05,950 --> 00:44:07,420
Is that it?

419
00:44:07,420 --> 00:44:22,370
Well, then, my pet, suppose you make it your business to write a note to young Carl von Sempach, and say I'm afraid I was rather rude to him yesterday, but if he'll overlook it, and come take a snug family dinner and a slice of the pudding with us today——"

420
00:44:22,370 --> 00:44:28,630
"Why, pa, you don't mean—yes, I really do believe you do——"

421
00:44:28,630 --> 00:44:32,880
The baron's eyes were winking nineteen to the dozen.

422
00:44:32,880 --> 00:44:35,170
"Why, you dear, dear, dear old pa!"

423
00:44:35,170 --> 00:44:44,140
and at the imminent risk of upsetting the breakfast table, Bertha rushed at the baron, and flinging two soft white arms about his neck, kissed him—oh!

424
00:44:44,140 --> 00:44:45,690
how she did kiss him!

425
00:44:45,690 --> 00:44:54,790
I shouldn't have thought, myself, she could possibly have had any left for Carl; but I dare say Bertha attended to his interests in that respect somehow.

426
00:44:54,790 --> 00:45:05,500
Well, Carl came to dinner, and the baron was, not very many years after, promoted to the dignity of a grandpapa, and a very jolly old grandpapa he made.

427
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:07,810
Is that all you wanted to know?

428
00:45:07,810 --> 00:45:09,400
About Klootz?

429
00:45:09,400 --> 00:45:13,800
Well, Klootz got over the kicking, but he was dismissed from the baron's service;

430
00:45:13,800 --> 00:45:22,810
and on examination of his accounts it was discovered that he had been in the habit of robbing the baron of nearly a third of his yearly income, which he had to refund;

431
00:45:22,810 --> 00:45:30,500
and with the money he was thus compelled to disgorge, the baron built new cottages for his tenants, and new-stocked their farms.

432
00:45:30,500 --> 00:45:40,850
Nor was he poorer in the end, for his tenants worked with the energy of gratitude, and he was soon many times richer than when the goblin visited him on that Christmas eve.

433
00:45:40,850 --> 00:45:45,110
And was the goblin ever explained?

434
00:45:45,110 --> 00:45:46,070
Certainly not.

435
00:45:46,070 --> 00:45:49,390
How dare you have the impertinence to suppose such a thing?

436
00:45:49,390 --> 00:46:00,660
An empty bottle, covered with cobwebs, was found the next morning in the turret-chamber, which the baron at first imagined must be the bottle from which the goblin produced his magic wine;

437
00:46:00,660 --> 00:46:08,600
but as it was found, on examination, to be labelled "Old Jamaica Rum," of course that could not have had anything to do with it.

438
00:46:08,600 --> 00:46:25,680
However it was, the baron never thoroughly enjoyed any other wine after it, and as he did not thenceforth get intoxicated, on an average, more than two nights a week, or swear more than eight oaths a day, I think King Christmas may be considered to have thoroughly reformed him.

439
00:46:25,680 --> 00:46:34,870
And he always maintained, to the day of his death, that he was changed into a fairy, and became exceedingly angry if contradicted.

440
00:46:34,870 --> 00:46:38,040
Who doesn't believe in fairies after this?

441
00:46:38,040 --> 00:46:46,530
I only hope King Christmas may make a few more good fairies this year, to brighten the homes of the poor with the light of Christmas charity.

442
00:46:46,530 --> 00:46:49,090
Truly, we need not look far for alms-men.

443
00:46:49,090 --> 00:46:59,210
Cold and hunger, disease and death, are around us at all times; but at no time do they press more heavily on the poor than at this jovial Christmas season.

444
00:46:59,210 --> 00:47:03,730
Shall we shut out, in our mirth and jollity, the cry of the hungry poor?

445
00:47:03,730 --> 00:47:20,670
or shall we not rather remember, in the midst of our happy family circles, round our well-filled tables and before our blazing fires, that our brothers are starving out in the cold, and that the Christmas song of the angels was "Good-will to men"?

CHRISTMAS WITH THE BARON
