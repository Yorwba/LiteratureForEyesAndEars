00:00:20,280 --> 00:00:21,340
Chapter 1

8
00:00:21,340 --> 00:00:22,870
THE PROPHECY

9
00:00:22,870 --> 00:00:33,550
Trevlyn lands and Trevlyn gold, Heir nor heiress e'er shall hold, Undisturbed, till, spite of rust, Truth is found in Trevlyn dust.

10
00:00:33,550 --> 00:00:36,670
"This is the third time I've found you poring over that old rhyme.

11
00:00:36,670 --> 00:00:38,200
What is the charm, Richard?

12
00:00:38,200 --> 00:00:40,120
Not its poetry I fancy."

13
00:00:40,120 --> 00:00:49,090
And the young wife laid a slender hand on the yellow, time-worn page where, in Old English text, appeared the lines she laughed at.

14
00:00:49,090 --> 00:00:54,810
Richard Trevlyn looked up with a smile and threw by the book, as if annoyed at being discovered reading it.

15
00:00:54,810 --> 00:01:07,710
Drawing his wife's hand through his own, he led her back to her couch, folded the soft shawls about her, and, sitting in a low chair beside her, said in a cheerful tone, though his eyes betrayed some hidden care,

16
00:01:07,710 --> 00:01:16,280
"My love, that book is a history of our family for centuries, and that old prophecy has never yet been fulfilled, except the 'heir and heiress' line.

17
00:01:16,280 --> 00:01:25,220
I am the last Trevlyn, and as the time draws near when my child shall be born, I naturally think of his future, and hope he will enjoy his heritage in peace."

18
00:01:25,220 --> 00:01:26,900
"God grant it!"

19
00:01:26,900 --> 00:01:37,470
softly echoed Lady Trevlyn, adding, with a look askance at the old book, "I read that history once, and fancied it must be a romance, such dreadful things are recorded in it.

20
00:01:37,470 --> 00:01:39,330
Is it all true, Richard?"

21
00:01:39,330 --> 00:01:40,640
"Yes, dear.

22
00:01:40,640 --> 00:01:42,000
I wish it was not.

23
00:01:42,000 --> 00:01:45,770
Ours has been a wild, unhappy race till the last generation or two.

24
00:01:45,770 --> 00:01:58,780
The stormy nature came in with old Sir Ralph, the fierce Norman knight, who killed his only son in a fit of wrath, by a blow with his steel gauntlet, because the boy's strong will would not yield to his."

25
00:01:58,780 --> 00:02:05,250
"Yes, I remember, and his daughter Clotilde held the castle during a siege, and married her cousin, Count Hugo.

26
00:02:05,250 --> 00:02:09,110
'Tis a warlike race, and I like it in spite of the mad deeds."

27
00:02:09,110 --> 00:02:10,610
"Married her cousin!

28
00:02:10,610 --> 00:02:14,070
That has been the bane of our family in times past.

29
00:02:14,070 --> 00:02:19,900
Being too proud to mate elsewhere, we have kept to ourselves till idiots and lunatics began to appear.

30
00:02:19,900 --> 00:02:30,380
My father was the first who broke the law among us, and I followed his example: choosing the freshest, sturdiest flower I could find to transplant into our exhausted soil."

31
00:02:30,380 --> 00:02:34,560
"I hope it will do you honor by blossoming bravely.

32
00:02:34,560 --> 00:02:40,430
I never forget that you took me from a very humble home, and made me the happiest wife in England."

33
00:02:40,430 --> 00:02:50,560
"And I never forget that you, a girl of eighteen, consented to leave your hills and come to cheer the long-deserted house of an old man like me," returned her husband fondly.

34
00:02:50,560 --> 00:02:56,850
"Nay, don't call yourself old, Richard; you are only forty-five, the boldest, handsomest man in Warwickshire.

35
00:02:56,850 --> 00:02:59,970
But lately you look worried; what is it?

36
00:02:59,970 --> 00:03:01,990
Tell me, and let me advise or comfort you."

37
00:03:01,990 --> 00:03:09,480
"It is nothing, Alice, except my natural anxiety for youâ€”Well, Kingston, what do you want?"

38
00:03:09,480 --> 00:03:19,060
Trevlyn's tender tones grew sharp as he addressed the entering servant, and the smile on his lips vanished, leaving them dry and white as he glanced at the card he handed him.

39
00:03:19,060 --> 00:03:23,280
An instant he stood staring at it, then asked, "Is the man here?"

40
00:03:23,280 --> 00:03:25,190
"In the library, sir."

41
00:03:25,190 --> 00:03:26,900
"I'll come."

42
00:03:26,900 --> 00:03:36,310
Flinging the card into the fire, he watched it turn to ashes before he spoke, with averted eyes: "Only some annoying business, love; I shall be with you again.

43
00:03:36,310 --> 00:03:38,320
Lie and rest till I come."

44
00:03:38,320 --> 00:03:45,190
With a hasty caress he left her, but as he passed a mirror, his wife saw an expression of intense excitement in his face.

45
00:03:45,190 --> 00:03:51,110
She said nothing, and lay motionless for several minutes evidently struggling with some strong impulse.

46
00:03:51,110 --> 00:03:57,640
"He is ill and anxious, but he hides it from me; I have a right to know, and he'll forgive me when I prove that it does no harm."

47
00:03:57,640 --> 00:04:12,420
As she spoke to herself she rose, glided noiselessly through the hall, entered a small closet built in the thickness of the wall, and, bending to the keyhole of a narrow door, listened with a half-smile on her lips at the trespass she was committing.

48
00:04:12,420 --> 00:04:14,330
A murmur of voices met her ear.

49
00:04:14,330 --> 00:04:20,700
Her husband spoke oftenest, and suddenly some word of his dashed the smile off her face as if with a blow.

50
00:04:20,700 --> 00:04:27,490
She started, shrank, and shivered, bending lower with set teeth, white cheeks, and panic-stricken heart.

51
00:04:27,490 --> 00:04:42,690
Paler and paler grew her lips, wilder and wilder her eyes, fainter and fainter her breath, till, with a long sigh, a vain effort to save herself, she sank prone upon the threshold of the door, as if struck down by death.

52
00:04:42,690 --> 00:04:45,350
"Mercy on us, my lady, are you ill?"

53
00:04:45,350 --> 00:04:51,340
cried Hester, the maid, as her mistress glided into the room looking like a ghost, half an hour later.

54
00:04:51,340 --> 00:04:53,280
"I am faint and cold.

55
00:04:53,280 --> 00:04:56,840
Help me to my bed, and do not disturb Sir Richard."

56
00:04:56,840 --> 00:05:06,370
A shiver crept over her as she spoke, and, casting a wild, woeful look about her, she laid her head upon the pillow like one who never cared to lift it up again.

57
00:05:06,370 --> 00:05:15,540
Hester, a sharp-eyed, middle-aged woman, watched the pale creature for a moment, then left the room muttering, "Something is wrong, and Sir Richard must know it.

58
00:05:15,540 --> 00:05:18,670
That black-bearded man came for no good, I'll warrant."

59
00:05:18,670 --> 00:05:21,140
At the door of the library she paused.

60
00:05:21,140 --> 00:05:29,530
No sound of voices came from within; a stifled groan was all she heard; and without waiting to knock she went in, fearing she knew not what.

61
00:05:29,530 --> 00:05:39,400
Sir Richard sat at his writing table pen in hand, but his face was hidden on his arm, and his whole attitude betrayed the presence of some overwhelming despair.

62
00:05:39,400 --> 00:05:41,510
"Please, sir, my lady is ill.

63
00:05:41,510 --> 00:05:43,050
Shall I send for anyone?"

64
00:05:43,050 --> 00:05:44,360
No answer.

65
00:05:44,360 --> 00:05:48,180
Hester repeated her words, but Sir Richard never stirred.

66
00:05:48,180 --> 00:05:53,800
Much alarmed, the old woman raised his head, saw that he was unconscious, and rang for help.

67
00:05:53,800 --> 00:05:57,450
But Richard Trevlyn was past help, though he lingered for some hours.

68
00:05:57,450 --> 00:06:02,750
He spoke but once, murmuring faintly, "Will Alice come to say good-bye?"

69
00:06:02,750 --> 00:06:06,120
"Bring her if she can come," said the physician.

70
00:06:06,120 --> 00:06:11,930
Hester went, found her mistress lying as she left her, like a figure carved in stone.

71
00:06:11,930 --> 00:06:22,560
When she gave the message, Lady Trevlyn answered sternly, "Tell him I will not come," and turned her face to the wall, with an expression which daunted the woman too much for another word.

72
00:06:22,560 --> 00:06:32,130
Hester whispered the hard answer to the physician, fearing to utter it aloud, but Sir Richard heard it, and died with a despairing prayer for pardon on his lips.

73
00:06:32,130 --> 00:06:44,110
When day dawned Sir Richard lay in his shroud and his little daughter in her cradle, the one unwept, the other unwelcomed by the wife and mother, who, twelve hours before, had called herself the happiest woman in England.

74
00:06:44,110 --> 00:06:50,680
They thought her dying, and at her own command gave her the sealed letter bearing her address which her husband left behind him.

75
00:06:50,680 --> 00:07:01,150
She read it, laid it in her bosom, and, waking from the trance which seemed to have so strongly chilled and changed her, besought those about her with passionate earnestness to save her life.

76
00:07:01,150 --> 00:07:12,180
For two days she hovered on the brink of the grave, and nothing but the indomitable will to live saved her, the doctors said.

77
00:07:12,180 --> 00:07:18,860
On the third day she rallied wonderfully, and some purpose seemed to gift her with unnatural strength.

78
00:07:18,860 --> 00:07:27,780
Evening came, and the house was very still, for all the sad bustle of preparation for Sir Richard's funeral was over, and he lay for the last night under his own roof.

79
00:07:27,780 --> 00:07:38,290
Hester sat in the darkened chamber of her mistress, and no sound broke the hush but the low lullaby the nurse was singing to the fatherless baby in the adjoining room.

80
00:07:38,290 --> 00:07:44,640
Lady Trevlyn seemed to sleep, but suddenly put back the curtain, saying abruptly, "Where does he lie?"

81
00:07:44,640 --> 00:07:55,600
"In the state chamber, my lady," replied Hester, anxiously watching the feverish glitter of her mistress's eye, the flush on her cheek, and the unnatural calmness of her manner.

82
00:07:55,600 --> 00:07:58,770
"Help me to go there; I must see him."

83
00:07:58,770 --> 00:08:00,810
"It would be your death, my lady.

84
00:08:00,810 --> 00:08:10,110
I beseech you, don't think of it," began the woman; but Lady Trevlyn seemed not to hear her, and something in the stern pallor of her face awed the woman into submission.

85
00:08:10,110 --> 00:08:18,070
Wrapping the slight form of her mistress in a warm cloak, Hester half-led, half-carried her to the state room, and left her on the threshold.

86
00:08:18,070 --> 00:08:24,510
"I must go in alone; fear nothing, but wait for me here," she said, and closed the door behind her.

87
00:08:24,510 --> 00:08:29,340
Five minutes had not elapsed when she reappeared with no sign of grief on her rigid face.

88
00:08:29,340 --> 00:08:38,000
"Take me to my bed and bring my jewel box," she said, with a shuddering sigh, as the faithful servant received her with an exclamation of thankfulness.

89
00:08:38,000 --> 00:08:44,060
When her orders had been obeyed, she drew from her bosom the portrait of Sir Richard which she always wore,

90
00:08:44,060 --> 00:08:52,200
and, removing the ivory oval from the gold case, she locked the former in a tiny drawer of the casket, replaced the empty locket in her breast,

91
00:08:52,200 --> 00:08:58,280
and bade Hester give the jewels to Watson, her lawyer, who would see them put in a safe place till the child was grown.

92
00:08:58,280 --> 00:09:05,700
"Dear heart, my lady, you'll wear them yet, for you're too young to grieve all your days, even for so good a man as my blessed master.

93
00:09:05,700 --> 00:09:09,930
Take comfort, and cheer up, for the dear child's sake if no more."

94
00:09:09,930 --> 00:09:16,220
"I shall never wear them again" was all the answer as Lady Trevlyn drew the curtains, as if to shut out hope.

95
00:09:16,220 --> 00:09:27,720
Sir Richard was buried and, the nine days' gossip over, the mystery of his death died for want of food, for the only person who could have explained it was in a state which forbade all allusion to that tragic day.

96
00:09:27,720 --> 00:09:31,730
For a year later, Lady Trevlyn's reason was in danger.

97
00:09:31,730 --> 00:09:39,970
A long fever left her so weak in mind and body that there was little hope of recovery, and her days were passed in a state of apathy sad to witness.

98
00:09:39,970 --> 00:09:44,600
She seemed to have forgotten everything, even the shock which had so sorely stricken her.

99
00:09:44,600 --> 00:09:53,780
The sight of her child failed to rouse her, and month after month slipped by, leaving no trace of their passage on her mind, and but slightly renovating her feeble body.

100
00:09:53,780 --> 00:09:59,520
Who the stranger was, what his aim in coming, or why he never reappeared, no one discovered.

101
00:09:59,520 --> 00:10:06,930
The contents of the letter left by Sir Richard were unknown, for the paper had been destroyed by Lady Trevlyn and no clue could be got from her.

102
00:10:06,930 --> 00:10:13,960
Sir Richard had died of heart disease, the physicians said, though he might have lived years had no sudden shock assailed him.

103
00:10:13,960 --> 00:10:26,530
There were few relatives to make investigations, and friends soon forgot the sad young widow; so the years rolled on, and Lillian the heiress grew from infancy to childhood in the shadow of this mystery.

00:10:46,640 --> 00:10:47,800
Chapter 2

109
00:10:47,800 --> 00:10:48,920
PAUL

110
00:10:48,920 --> 00:10:52,760
"Come, child, the dew is falling, and it is time we went in."

111
00:10:52,760 --> 00:10:58,270
"No, no, Mamma is not rested yet, so I may run down to the spring if I like."

112
00:10:58,270 --> 00:11:04,840
And Lillian, as willful as winsome, vanished among the tall ferns where deer crouched and rabbits hid.

113
00:11:04,840 --> 00:11:14,950
Hester leisurely followed, looking as unchanged as if a day instead of twelve years had passed since her arms received the little mistress, who now ruled her like a tyrant.

114
00:11:14,950 --> 00:11:21,920
She had taken but a few steps when the child came flying back, exclaiming in an excited tone, "Oh, come quick!

115
00:11:21,920 --> 00:11:23,650
There's a man there, a dead man.

116
00:11:23,650 --> 00:11:25,450
I saw him and I'm frightened!"

117
00:11:25,450 --> 00:11:30,610
"Nonsense, child, it's one of the keepers asleep, or some stroller who has no business here.

118
00:11:30,610 --> 00:11:33,190
Take my hand and we'll see who he is."

119
00:11:33,190 --> 00:11:41,660
Somewhat reassured, Lillian led her nurse to one of the old oaks beside the path, and pointed to a figure lying half hidden in the fern.

120
00:11:41,660 --> 00:11:56,140
A slender, swarthy boy of sixteen, with curly black hair, dark brows, and thick lashes, a singularly stern mouth, and a general expression of strength and pride, which added character to his boyish face and dignified his poverty.

121
00:11:56,140 --> 00:12:05,570
His dress betrayed that, being dusty and threadbare, his shoes much worn, and his possessions contained in the little bundle on which he pillowed his head.

122
00:12:05,570 --> 00:12:13,390
He was sleeping like one quite spent with weariness, and never stirred, though Hester bent away the ferns and examined him closely.

123
00:12:13,390 --> 00:12:20,010
"He's not dead, my deary; he's asleep, poor lad, worn out with his day's tramp, I dare say."

124
00:12:20,010 --> 00:12:23,130
"I'm glad he's alive, and I wish he'd wake up.

125
00:12:23,130 --> 00:12:24,870
He's a pretty boy, isn't he?

126
00:12:24,870 --> 00:12:28,790
See what nice hands he's got, and his hair is more curly than mine.

127
00:12:28,790 --> 00:12:35,430
Make him open his eyes, Hester," commanded the little lady, whose fear had given place to interest.

128
00:12:35,430 --> 00:12:37,670
"Hush, he's stirring.

129
00:12:37,670 --> 00:12:41,350
I wonder how he got in, and what he wants," whispered Hester.

130
00:12:41,350 --> 00:12:50,000
"I'll ask him," and before her nurse could arrest her, Lillian drew a tall fern softly over the sleeper's face, laughing aloud as she did so.

131
00:12:50,000 --> 00:12:57,830
The boy woke at the sound, and without stirring lay looking up at the lovely little face bent over him, as if still in a dream.

132
00:12:57,830 --> 00:13:01,120
"Bella cara," he said, in a musical voice.

133
00:13:01,120 --> 00:13:11,400
Then, as the child drew back abashed at the glance of his large, bright eyes, he seemed to wake entirely and, springing to his feet, looked at Hester with a quick, searching glance.

134
00:13:11,400 --> 00:13:19,370
Something in his face and air caused the woman to soften her tone a little, as she said gravely, "Did you wish to see any one at the Hall?"

135
00:13:19,370 --> 00:13:20,440
"Yes.

136
00:13:20,440 --> 00:13:21,890
Is Lady Trevlyn here?"

137
00:13:21,890 --> 00:13:27,450
was the boy's answer, as he stood cap in hand, with the smile fading already from his face.

138
00:13:27,450 --> 00:13:34,960
"She is, but unless your business is very urgent you had better see Parks, the keeper; we don't trouble my lady with trifles."

139
00:13:34,960 --> 00:13:41,630
"I've a note for her from Colonel Daventry; and as it is not a trifle, I'll deliver it myself, if you please."

140
00:13:41,630 --> 00:13:50,230
Hester hesitated an instant, but Lillian cried out, "Mamma is close by, come and see her," and led the way, beckoning as she ran.

141
00:13:50,230 --> 00:13:57,080
The lad followed with a composed air, and Hester brought up the rear, taking notes as she went with a woman's keen eye.

142
00:13:57,080 --> 00:14:09,010
Lady Trevlyn, a beautiful, pale woman, delicate in health and melancholy in spirit, sat on a rustic seat with a book in her hand; not reading, but musing with an absent mind.

143
00:14:09,010 --> 00:14:14,430
As the child approached, she held out her hand to welcome her, but neither smiled nor spoke.

144
00:14:14,430 --> 00:14:24,100
"Mamma, here is aâ€”a person to see you," cried Lillian, rather at a loss how to designate the stranger, whose height and gravity now awed her.

145
00:14:24,100 --> 00:14:29,100
"A note from Colonel Daventry, my lady," and with a bow the boy delivered the missive.

146
00:14:29,100 --> 00:14:33,120
Scarcely glancing at him, she opened it and read:

147
00:14:33,120 --> 00:14:34,690
My Dear Friend,

148
00:14:34,690 --> 00:14:39,800
The bearer of this, Paul Jex, has been with me some months and has served me well.

149
00:14:39,800 --> 00:14:47,470
I brought him from Paris, but he is English born, and, though friendless, prefers to remain here, even after we leave, as we do in a week.

150
00:14:47,470 --> 00:14:56,860
When I last saw you you mentioned wanting a lad to help in the garden; Paul is accustomed to that employment, though my wife used him as a sort of page in the house.

151
00:14:56,860 --> 00:15:00,800
Hoping you may be able to give him shelter, I venture to send him.

152
00:15:00,800 --> 00:15:04,950
He is honest, capable, and trustworthy in all respects.

153
00:15:04,950 --> 00:15:07,210
Pray try him, and oblige,

154
00:15:07,210 --> 00:15:08,680
Yours sincerely,

155
00:15:08,680 --> 00:15:09,200
J.

156
00:15:09,200 --> 00:15:09,570
R.

157
00:15:09,570 --> 00:15:10,780
Daventry

158
00:15:10,780 --> 00:15:21,060
"The place is still vacant, and I shall be very glad to give it to you, if you incline to take it," said Lady Trevlyn, lifting her eyes from the note and scanning the boy's face.

159
00:15:21,060 --> 00:15:24,270
"I do, madam," he answered respectfully.

160
00:15:24,270 --> 00:15:28,910
"The colonel says you are English," added the lady, in a tone of surprise.

161
00:15:28,910 --> 00:15:38,160
The boy smiled, showing a faultless set of teeth, as he replied, "I am, my lady, though just now I may not look it, being much tanned and very dusty.

162
00:15:38,160 --> 00:15:44,690
My father was an Englishman, but I've lived abroad a good deal since he died, and got foreign ways, perhaps."

163
00:15:44,690 --> 00:15:53,810
As he spoke without any accent, and looked full in her face with a pair of honest blue eyes under the dark lashes, Lady Trevlyn's momentary doubt vanished.

164
00:15:53,810 --> 00:15:55,590
"Your age, Paul?"

165
00:15:55,590 --> 00:15:57,780
"Sixteen, my lady."

166
00:15:57,780 --> 00:15:59,920
"You understand gardening?"

167
00:15:59,920 --> 00:16:01,620
"Yes, my lady."

168
00:16:01,620 --> 00:16:03,130
"And what else?"

169
00:16:03,130 --> 00:16:14,440
"I can break horses, serve at table, do errands, read aloud, ride after a young lady as groom, illuminate on parchment, train flowers, and make myself useful in any way."

170
00:16:14,440 --> 00:16:27,330
The tone, half modest, half eager, in which the boy spoke, as well as the odd list of his accomplishments, brought a smile to Lady Trevlyn's lips, and the general air of the lad prepossessed her.

171
00:16:27,330 --> 00:16:33,760
"I want Lillian to ride soon, and Roger is rather old for an escort to such a little horsewoman.

172
00:16:33,760 --> 00:16:35,700
Don't you think we might try Paul?"

173
00:16:35,700 --> 00:16:37,920
she said, turning to Hester.

174
00:16:37,920 --> 00:16:47,580
The woman gravely eyed the lad from head to foot, and shook her head, but an imploring little gesture and a glance of the handsome eyes softened her heart in spite of herself.

175
00:16:47,580 --> 00:16:53,810
"Yes, my lady, if he does well about the place, and Parks thinks he's steady enough, we might try it by-and-by."

176
00:16:53,810 --> 00:17:01,950
Lillian clapped her hands and, drawing nearer, exclaimed confidingly, as she looked up at her new groom, "I know he'll do, Mamma.

177
00:17:01,950 --> 00:17:05,670
I like him very much, and I hope you'll let him train my pony for me.

178
00:17:05,670 --> 00:17:06,980
Will you, Paul?"

179
00:17:06,980 --> 00:17:08,420
"Yes."

180
00:17:08,420 --> 00:17:17,630
As he spoke very low and hastily, the boy looked away from the eager little face before him, and a sudden flush of color crossed his dark cheek.

181
00:17:17,630 --> 00:17:22,880
Hester saw it and said within herself, "That boy has good blood in his veins.

182
00:17:22,880 --> 00:17:28,550
He's no clodhopper's son, I can tell by his hands and feet, his air and walk.

183
00:17:28,550 --> 00:17:34,040
Poor lad, it's hard for him, I'll warrant, but he's not too proud for honest work, and I like that."

184
00:17:34,040 --> 00:17:37,370
"You may stay, Paul, and we will try you for a month.

185
00:17:37,370 --> 00:17:40,920
Hester, take him to Parks and see that he is made comfortable.

186
00:17:40,920 --> 00:17:43,640
Tomorrow we will see what he can do.

187
00:17:43,640 --> 00:17:46,050
Come, darling, I am rested now."

188
00:17:46,050 --> 00:17:52,260
As she spoke, Lady Trevlyn dismissed the boy with a gracious gesture and led her little daughter away.

189
00:17:52,260 --> 00:18:04,420
Paul stood watching her, as if forgetful of his companion, till she said, rather tartly, "Young man, you'd better have thanked my lady while she was here than stare after her now it's too late.

190
00:18:04,420 --> 00:18:07,680
If you want to see Parks, you'd best come, for I'm going."

191
00:18:07,680 --> 00:18:11,410
"Is that the family tomb yonder, where you found me asleep?"

192
00:18:11,410 --> 00:18:17,450
was the unexpected reply to her speech, as the boy quietly followed her, not at all daunted by her manner.

193
00:18:17,450 --> 00:18:23,980
"Yes, and that reminds me to ask how you got in, and why you were napping there, instead of doing your errand properly?"

194
00:18:23,980 --> 00:18:33,160
"I leaped the fence and stopped to rest before presenting myself, Miss Hester" was the cool answer, accompanied by a short laugh as he confessed his trespass.

195
00:18:33,160 --> 00:18:37,100
"You look as if you'd had a long walk; where are you from?"

196
00:18:37,100 --> 00:18:38,570
"London."

197
00:18:38,570 --> 00:18:39,700
"Bless the boy!

198
00:18:39,700 --> 00:18:42,120
It's fifty miles away."

199
00:18:42,120 --> 00:18:46,460
"So my shoes show; but it's a pleasant trip in summer time."

200
00:18:46,460 --> 00:18:48,230
"But why did you walk, child!

201
00:18:48,230 --> 00:18:49,680
Had you no money?"

202
00:18:49,680 --> 00:18:54,510
"Plenty, but not for wasting on coaches, when my own stout legs could carry me.

203
00:18:54,510 --> 00:18:58,460
I took a two days' holiday and saved my money for better things."

204
00:18:58,460 --> 00:19:02,090
"I like that," said Hester, with an approving nod.

205
00:19:02,090 --> 00:19:09,240
"You'll get on, my lad, if that's your way, and I'll lend a hand, for laziness is my abomination, and one sees plenty nowadays."

206
00:19:09,240 --> 00:19:10,350
"Thank you.

207
00:19:10,350 --> 00:19:13,050
That's friendly, and I'll prove that I am grateful.

208
00:19:13,050 --> 00:19:15,940
Please tell me, is my lady ill?"

209
00:19:15,940 --> 00:19:19,480
"Always delicate since Sir Richard died."

210
00:19:19,480 --> 00:19:21,740
"How long ago was that?"

211
00:19:21,740 --> 00:19:23,760
"Ten years or more."

212
00:19:23,760 --> 00:19:26,610
"Are there no young gentlemen in the family?"

213
00:19:26,610 --> 00:19:30,880
"No, Miss Lillian is an only child, and a sweet one, bless her!"

214
00:19:30,880 --> 00:19:33,810
"A proud little lady, I should say."

215
00:19:33,810 --> 00:19:40,450
"And well she may be, for there's no better blood in England than the Trevlyns, and she's heiress to a noble fortune."

216
00:19:40,450 --> 00:19:42,600
"Is that the Trevlyn coat of arms?"

217
00:19:42,600 --> 00:19:50,800
asked the boy abruptly, pointing to a stone falcon with the motto ME AND MINE carved over the gate through which they were passing.

218
00:19:50,800 --> 00:19:51,900
"Yes.

219
00:19:51,900 --> 00:19:53,430
Why do you ask?"

220
00:19:53,430 --> 00:19:59,260
"Mere curiosity; I know something of heraldry and often paint these things for my own pleasure.

221
00:19:59,260 --> 00:20:04,860
One learns odd amusements abroad," he added, seeing an expression of surprise on the woman's face.

222
00:20:04,860 --> 00:20:08,410
"You'll have little time for such matters here.

223
00:20:08,410 --> 00:20:15,460
Come in and report yourself to the keeper, and if you'll take my advice ask no questions of him, for you'll get no answers."

224
00:20:15,460 --> 00:20:19,730
"I seldom ask questions of men, as they are not fond of gossip."

225
00:20:19,730 --> 00:20:25,210
And the boy nodded with a smile of mischievous significance as he entered the keeper's lodge.

226
00:20:25,210 --> 00:20:27,880
A sharp lad and a saucy, if he likes.

227
00:20:27,880 --> 00:20:35,540
I'll keep my eye on him, for my lady takes no more thought of such things than a child, and Lillian cares for nothing but her own will.

228
00:20:35,540 --> 00:20:39,540
He has a taking way with him, though, and knows how to flatter.

229
00:20:39,540 --> 00:20:44,890
It's well he does, poor lad, for life's a hard matter to a friendless soul like him.

230
00:20:44,890 --> 00:20:56,560
As she thought these thoughts Hester went on to the house, leaving Paul to win the good graces of the keeper, which he speedily did by assuming an utterly different manner from that he had worn with the woman.

231
00:20:56,560 --> 00:21:10,480
That night, when the boy was alone in his own room, he wrote a long letter in Italian describing the events of the day, enclosed a sketch of the falcon and motto, directed it to "Father Cosmo Carmela, Genoa,"

232
00:21:10,480 --> 00:21:24,140
and lay down to sleep, muttering, with a grim look and a heavy sigh, "So far so well; I'll not let my heart be softened by pity, or my purpose change till my promise is kept.

233
00:21:24,140 --> 00:21:27,810
Pretty child, I wish I had never seen her!"

234
00:21:27,810 --> 00:21:30,150

00:21:56,820 --> 00:21:58,160
Chapter 3

242
00:21:58,160 --> 00:22:00,330
SECRET SERVICE

243
00:22:00,330 --> 00:22:10,770
In a week Paul was a favorite with the household; even prudent Hester felt the charm of his presence, and owned that Lillian was happier for a young companion in her walks.

244
00:22:10,770 --> 00:22:27,060
Hitherto the child had led a solitary life, with no playmates of her own age, such being the will of my lady; therefore she welcomed Paul as a new and delightful amusement, considering him her private property and soon transferring his duties from the garden to the house.

245
00:22:27,060 --> 00:22:35,880
Satisfied of his merits, my lady yielded to Lillian's demands, and Paul was installed as page to the young lady.

246
00:22:35,880 --> 00:22:45,330
Always respectful and obedient, he never forgot his place, yet seemed unconsciously to influence all who approached him, and win the goodwill of everyone.

247
00:22:45,330 --> 00:22:54,640
My lady showed unusual interest in the lad, and Lillian openly displayed her admiration for his accomplishments and her affection for her devoted young servitor.

248
00:22:54,640 --> 00:23:05,790
Hester was much flattered by the confidence he reposed in her, for to her alone did he tell his story, and of her alone asked advice and comfort in his various small straits.

249
00:23:05,790 --> 00:23:15,490
It was as she suspected: Paul was a gentleman's son, but misfortune had robbed him of home, friends, and parents, and thrown him upon the world to shift for himself.

250
00:23:15,490 --> 00:23:21,180
This sad story touched the woman's heart, and the boy's manly spirit won respect.

251
00:23:21,180 --> 00:23:26,570
She had lost a son years ago, and her empty heart yearned over the motherless lad.

252
00:23:26,570 --> 00:23:36,760
Ashamed to confess the tender feeling, she wore her usual severe manner to him in public, but in private softened wonderfully and enjoyed the boy's regard heartily.

253
00:23:36,760 --> 00:23:38,480
"Paul, come in.

254
00:23:38,480 --> 00:23:46,300
I want to speak with you a moment," said my lady, from the long window of the library to the boy who was training vines outside.

255
00:23:46,300 --> 00:23:54,350
Dropping his tools and pulling off his hat, Paul obeyed, looking a little anxious, for the month of trial expired that day.

256
00:23:54,350 --> 00:23:58,880
Lady Trevlyn saw and answered the look with a gracious smile.

257
00:23:58,880 --> 00:24:00,360
"Have no fears.

258
00:24:00,360 --> 00:24:05,010
You are to stay if you will, for Lillian is happy and I am satisfied with you."

259
00:24:05,010 --> 00:24:06,880
"Thank you, my lady."

260
00:24:06,880 --> 00:24:11,790
And an odd glance of mingled pride and pain shone in the boy's downcast eyes.

261
00:24:11,790 --> 00:24:13,460
"That is settled, then.

262
00:24:13,460 --> 00:24:15,960
Now let me say what I called you in for.

263
00:24:15,960 --> 00:24:19,250
You spoke of being able to illuminate on parchment.

264
00:24:19,250 --> 00:24:21,750
Can you restore this old book for me?"

265
00:24:21,750 --> 00:24:26,870
She put into his hand the ancient volume Sir Richard had been reading the day he died.

266
00:24:26,870 --> 00:24:40,020
It had lain neglected in a damp nook for years till my lady discovered it, and, sad as were the associations connected with it, she desired to preserve it for the sake of the weird prophecy if nothing else.

267
00:24:40,020 --> 00:24:47,470
Paul examined it, and as he turned it to and fro in his hands it opened at the page oftenest read by its late master.

268
00:24:47,470 --> 00:24:57,040
His eye kindled as he looked, and with a quick gesture he turned as if toward the light, in truth to hide the flash of triumph that passed across his face.

269
00:24:57,040 --> 00:25:10,480
Carefully controlling his voice, he answered in a moment, as he looked up, quite composed, "Yes, my lady, I can retouch the faded colors on these margins and darken the pale ink of the Old English text.

270
00:25:10,480 --> 00:25:13,480
I like the work, and will gladly do it if you like."

271
00:25:13,480 --> 00:25:17,850
"Do it, then, but be very careful of the book while in your hands.

272
00:25:17,850 --> 00:25:23,330
Provide what is needful, and name your own price for the work," said his mistress.

273
00:25:23,330 --> 00:25:26,670
"Nay, my lady, I am already paidâ€”"

274
00:25:26,670 --> 00:25:28,240
"How so?"

275
00:25:28,240 --> 00:25:30,160
she asked, surprised.

276
00:25:30,160 --> 00:25:42,280
Paul had spoken hastily, and for an instant looked embarrassed, but answered with a sudden flush on his dark cheeks, "You have been kind to me, and I am glad to show my, gratitude in any way, my lady."

277
00:25:42,280 --> 00:25:44,310
"Let that pass, my boy.

278
00:25:44,310 --> 00:25:49,580
Do this little service for me and we will see about the recompense afterward."

279
00:25:49,580 --> 00:25:53,870
And with a smile Lady Trevlyn left him to begin his work.

280
00:25:53,870 --> 00:25:58,230
The moment the door closed behind her a total change passed over Paul.

281
00:25:58,230 --> 00:26:11,150
He shook his clenched hand after her with a gesture of menace, then tossed up the old book and caught it with an exclamation of delight, as he reopened it at the worn page and reread the inexplicable verse.

282
00:26:11,150 --> 00:26:13,710
"Another proof, another proof!

283
00:26:13,710 --> 00:26:21,210
The work goes bravely on, Father Cosmo; and boy as I am, I'll keep my word in spite of everything," he muttered.

284
00:26:21,210 --> 00:26:23,740
"What is that you'll keep, lad?"

285
00:26:23,740 --> 00:26:25,670
said a voice behind him.

286
00:26:25,670 --> 00:26:32,960
"I'll keep my word to my lady, and do my best to restore this book, Mrs. Hester," he answered, quickly recovering himself.

287
00:26:32,960 --> 00:26:36,430
"Ah, that's the last book poor Master read.

288
00:26:36,430 --> 00:26:41,820
I hid it away, but my lady found it in spite of me," said Hester, with a doleful sigh.

289
00:26:41,820 --> 00:26:43,560
"Did he die suddenly, then?"

290
00:26:43,560 --> 00:26:44,950
asked the boy.

291
00:26:44,950 --> 00:26:51,700
"Dear heart, yes; I found him dying in this room with the ink scarce dry on the letter he left for my lady.

292
00:26:51,700 --> 00:26:54,170
A mysterious business and a sad one."

293
00:26:54,170 --> 00:26:55,870
"Tell me about it.

294
00:26:55,870 --> 00:27:02,400
I like sad stories, and I already feel as if I belonged to the family, a loyal retainer as in the old times.

295
00:27:02,400 --> 00:27:08,340
While you dust the books and I rub the mold off this old cover, tell me the tale, please, Mrs. Hester."

296
00:27:08,340 --> 00:27:20,040
She shook her head, but yielded to the persuasive look and tone of the boy, telling the story more fully than she intended, for she loved talking and had come to regard Paul as her own, almost.

297
00:27:20,040 --> 00:27:21,350
"And the letter?

298
00:27:21,350 --> 00:27:22,430
What was in it?"

299
00:27:22,430 --> 00:27:25,450
asked the boy, as she paused at the catastrophe.

300
00:27:25,450 --> 00:27:28,250
"No one ever knew but my lady."

301
00:27:28,250 --> 00:27:30,370
"She destroyed it, then?"

302
00:27:30,370 --> 00:27:36,730
"I thought so, till a long time afterward, one of the lawyers came pestering me with questions, and made me ask her.

303
00:27:36,730 --> 00:27:44,810
She was ill at the time, but answered with a look I shall never forget, 'No, it's not burnt, but no one shall ever see it.'

304
00:27:44,810 --> 00:27:51,800
I dared ask no more, but I fancy she has it safe somewhere and if it's ever needed she'll bring it out.

305
00:27:51,800 --> 00:27:55,060
It was only some private matters, I fancy."

306
00:27:55,060 --> 00:27:56,740
"And the stranger?"

307
00:27:56,740 --> 00:28:00,550
"Oh, he vanished as oddly as he came, and has never been found.

308
00:28:00,550 --> 00:28:02,300
A strange story, lad.

309
00:28:02,300 --> 00:28:04,720
Keep silent, and let it rest."

310
00:28:04,720 --> 00:28:12,790
"No fear of my tattling," and the boy smiled curiously to himself as he bent over the book, polishing the brassbound cover.

311
00:28:12,790 --> 00:28:15,330
"What are you doing with that pretty white wax?"

312
00:28:15,330 --> 00:28:24,110
asked Lillian the next day, as she came upon Paul in a quiet corner of the garden and found him absorbed in some mysterious occupation.

313
00:28:24,110 --> 00:28:37,930
With a quick gesture he destroyed his work, and, banishing a momentary expression of annoyance, he answered in his accustomed tone as he began to work anew, "I am molding a little deer for you, Miss Lillian.

314
00:28:37,930 --> 00:28:42,190
See, here is a rabbit already done, and I'll soon have a stag also."

315
00:28:42,190 --> 00:28:43,790
"It's very pretty!

316
00:28:43,790 --> 00:28:49,310
How many nice things you can do, and how kind you are to think of my liking something new.

317
00:28:49,310 --> 00:28:53,340
Was this wax what you went to get this morning when you rode away so early?"

318
00:28:53,340 --> 00:28:54,980
asked the child.

319
00:28:54,980 --> 00:28:56,790
"Yes, Miss Lillian.

320
00:28:56,790 --> 00:29:00,720
I was ordered to exercise your pony and I made him useful as well.

321
00:29:00,720 --> 00:29:02,260
Would you like to try this?

322
00:29:02,260 --> 00:29:03,710
It's very easy."

323
00:29:03,710 --> 00:29:08,340
Lillian was charmed, and for several days wax modeling was her favorite play.

324
00:29:08,340 --> 00:29:16,720
Then she tired of it, and Paul invented a new amusement, smiling his inexplicable smile as he threw away the broken toys of wax.

325
00:29:16,720 --> 00:29:20,110
"You are getting pale and thin, keeping such late hours, Paul.

326
00:29:20,110 --> 00:29:28,300
Go to bed, boy, go to bed, and get your sleep early," said Hester a week afterward, with a motherly air, as Paul passed her one morning.

327
00:29:28,300 --> 00:29:30,720
"And how do you know I don't go to bed?"

328
00:29:30,720 --> 00:29:32,730
he asked, wheeling about.

329
00:29:32,730 --> 00:29:37,090
"My lady has been restless lately, and I sit up with her till she sleeps.

330
00:29:37,090 --> 00:29:45,140
As I go to my room, I see your lamp burning, and last night I got as far as your door, meaning to speak to you, but didn't, thinking you'd take it amiss.

331
00:29:45,140 --> 00:29:48,350
But really you are the worse for late hours, child."

332
00:29:48,350 --> 00:29:51,850
"I shall soon finish restoring the book, and then I'll sleep.

333
00:29:51,850 --> 00:29:53,370
I hope I don't disturb you.

334
00:29:53,370 --> 00:29:57,200
I have to grind my colors, and often make more noise than I mean to."

335
00:29:57,200 --> 00:30:07,310
Paul fixed his eyes sharply on the woman as he spoke, but she seemed unconscious of it, and turned to go on, saying indifferently, "Oh, that's the odd sound, is it?

336
00:30:07,310 --> 00:30:12,560
No, it doesn't trouble me, so grind away, and make an end of it as soon as may be."

337
00:30:12,560 --> 00:30:23,050
An anxious fold in the boy's forehead smoothed itself away as he left her, saying to himself with a sigh of relief, "A narrow escape; it's well I keep the door locked."

338
00:30:23,050 --> 00:30:29,400
The boy's light burned no more after that, and Hester was content till a new worry came to trouble her.

339
00:30:29,400 --> 00:30:37,210
On her way to her room late one night, she saw a tall shadow flit down one of the side corridors that branched from the main one.

340
00:30:37,210 --> 00:30:45,740
For a moment she was startled, but, being a woman of courage, she followed noiselessly, till the shadow seemed to vanish in the gloom of the great hall.

341
00:30:45,740 --> 00:30:51,930
"If the house ever owned a ghost I'd say that's it, but it never did, so I suspect some deviltry.

342
00:30:51,930 --> 00:30:53,140
I'll step to Paul.

343
00:30:53,140 --> 00:30:54,730
He's not asleep, I dare say.

344
00:30:54,730 --> 00:30:59,240
He's a brave and a sensible lad, and with him I'll quietly search the house."

345
00:30:59,240 --> 00:31:04,240
Away she went, more nervous than she would own, and tapped at the boy's door.

346
00:31:04,240 --> 00:31:10,590
No one answered, and, seeing that it was ajar, Hester whisked in so hurriedly that her candle went out.

347
00:31:10,590 --> 00:31:18,580
With an impatient exclamation at her carelessness she glided to the bed, drew the curtain, and put forth her hand to touch the sleeper.

348
00:31:18,580 --> 00:31:20,170
The bed was empty.

349
00:31:20,170 --> 00:31:26,240
A disagreeable thrill shot through her, as she assured herself of the fact by groping along the narrow bed.

350
00:31:26,240 --> 00:31:34,410
Standing in the shadow of the curtain, she stared about the dusky room, in which objects were visible by the light of a new moon.

351
00:31:34,410 --> 00:31:37,290
"Lord bless me, what is the boy about!

352
00:31:37,290 --> 00:31:46,340
I do believe it was him I saw in theâ€”" She got no further in her mental exclamation for the sound of light approaching footsteps neared her.

353
00:31:46,340 --> 00:31:57,620
Slipping around the bed she waited in the shadow, and a moment after Paul appeared, looking pale and ghostly, with dark, disheveled hair, wide-open eyes, and a cloak thrown over his shoulders.

354
00:31:57,620 --> 00:32:02,970
Without a pause he flung it off, laid himself in bed, and seemed to sleep at once.

355
00:32:02,970 --> 00:32:04,140
"Paul!

356
00:32:04,140 --> 00:32:05,050
Paul!"

357
00:32:05,050 --> 00:32:10,320
whispered Hester, shaking him, after a pause of astonishment at the whole proceeding.

358
00:32:10,320 --> 00:32:12,140
"Hey, what is it?"

359
00:32:12,140 --> 00:32:14,850
And he sat up, looking drowsily about him.

360
00:32:14,850 --> 00:32:16,980
"Come, come, no tricks, boy.

361
00:32:16,980 --> 00:32:21,130
What are you doing, trailing about the house at this hour and in such trim?"

362
00:32:21,130 --> 00:32:23,350
"Why, Hester, is it you?"

363
00:32:23,350 --> 00:32:27,730
he exclaimed with a laugh, as he shook off her grip and looked up at her in surprise.

364
00:32:27,730 --> 00:32:29,900
"Yes, and well it is me.

365
00:32:29,900 --> 00:32:33,990
If it had been any of those silly girls, the house would have been roused by this time.

366
00:32:33,990 --> 00:32:38,410
What mischief is afoot that you leave your bed and play ghost in this wild fashion?"

367
00:32:38,410 --> 00:32:39,890
"Leave my bed!

368
00:32:39,890 --> 00:32:45,050
Why, my good soul, I haven't stirred, but have been dreaming with all my might these two hours.

369
00:32:45,050 --> 00:32:46,750
What do you mean, Hester?"

370
00:32:46,750 --> 00:32:51,510
She told him as she relit her lamp, and stood eyeing him sharply the while.

371
00:32:51,510 --> 00:33:01,000
When she finished he was silent a minute, then said, looking half vexed and half ashamed, "I see how it is, and I'm glad you alone have found me out.

372
00:33:01,000 --> 00:33:04,240
I walk in my sleep sometimes, Hester, that's the truth.

373
00:33:04,240 --> 00:33:08,750
I thought I'd got over it, but it's come back, you see, and I'm sorry for it.

374
00:33:08,750 --> 00:33:10,020
Don't be troubled.

375
00:33:10,020 --> 00:33:12,850
I never do any mischief or come to any harm.

376
00:33:12,850 --> 00:33:15,730
I just take a quiet promenade and march back to bed again.

377
00:33:15,730 --> 00:33:17,400
Did I frighten you?"

378
00:33:17,400 --> 00:33:19,870
"Just a trifle, but it's nothing.

379
00:33:19,870 --> 00:33:27,710
Poor lad, you'll have to have a bedfellow or be locked up; it's dangerous to go roaming about in this way," said Hester anxiously.

380
00:33:27,710 --> 00:33:31,960
"It won't last long, for I'll get more tired and then I shall sleep sounder.

381
00:33:31,960 --> 00:33:35,890
Don't tell anyone, please, else they'll laugh at me, and that's not pleasant.

382
00:33:35,890 --> 00:33:41,670
I don't mind your knowing for you seem almost like a mother, and I thank you for it with all my heart."

383
00:33:41,670 --> 00:33:45,980
He held out his hand with the look that was irresistible to Hester.

384
00:33:45,980 --> 00:33:55,080
Remembering only that he was a motherless boy, she stroked the curly hair off his forehead, and kissed him, with the thought of her own son warm at her heart.

385
00:33:55,080 --> 00:33:56,320
"Good night, dear.

386
00:33:56,320 --> 00:34:01,830
I'll say nothing, but give you something that will ensure quiet sleep hereafter."

387
00:34:01,830 --> 00:34:12,400
With that she left him, but would have been annoyed could she have seen the convulsion of boyish merriment which took possession of him alone, for he laughed till the tears ran down his cheeks.

388

393
00:34:33,860 --> 00:34:35,350
VANISHED

394
00:34:35,350 --> 00:34:48,930
He's a handsome lad, and one any woman might be proud to call her son," said Hester to Bedford, the stately butler, as they lingered at the hall door one autumn morning to watch their young lady's departure on her daily ride.

395
00:34:48,930 --> 00:34:58,530
"You are right, Mrs. Hester, he's a fine lad, and yet he seems above his place, though he does look the very picture of a lady's groom," replied Bedford approvingly.

396
00:34:58,530 --> 00:35:08,510
So he did, as he stood holding the white pony of his little mistress, for the boy gave an air to whatever he wore and looked like a gentleman even in his livery.

397
00:35:08,510 --> 00:35:19,750
The dark-blue coat with silver buttons, the silver band about his hat, his white-topped boots and bright spurs, spotless gloves, and tightly drawn belt were all in perfect order,

398
00:35:19,750 --> 00:35:27,840
all becoming, and his handsome, dark face caused many a susceptible maid to blush and simper as they passed him.

399
00:35:27,840 --> 00:35:40,070
"Gentleman Paul," as the servants called him, was rather lofty and reserved among his mates, but they liked him nonetheless, for Hester had dropped hints of his story and quite a little romance had sprung up about him.

400
00:35:40,070 --> 00:35:48,340
He stood leaning against the docile creature, sunk in thought, and quite unconscious of the watchers and whisperers close by.

401
00:35:48,340 --> 00:35:57,920
But as Lillian appeared he woke up, attended to his duties like a well-trained groom, and lingered over his task as if he liked it.

402
00:35:57,920 --> 00:36:07,740
Down the avenue he rode behind her, but as they turned into a shady lane Lillian beckoned, saying, in the imperious tone habitual to her, "Ride near me.

403
00:36:07,740 --> 00:36:09,150
I wish to talk."

404
00:36:09,150 --> 00:36:19,810
Paul obeyed, and amused her with the chat she liked till they reached a hazel copse; here he drew rein, and, leaping down, gathered a handful of ripe nuts for her.

405
00:36:19,810 --> 00:36:21,060
"How nice.

406
00:36:21,060 --> 00:36:25,970
Let us rest a minute here, and while I eat a few, please pull some of those flowers for Mamma.

407
00:36:25,970 --> 00:36:30,180
She likes a wild nosegay better than any I can bring her from the garden."

408
00:36:30,180 --> 00:36:41,340
Lillian ate her nuts till Paul came to her with a hatful of late flowers and, standing by her, held the impromptu basket while she made up a bouquet to suit her taste.

409
00:36:41,340 --> 00:36:51,410
"You shall have a posy, too; I like you to wear one in your buttonhole as the ladies' grooms do in the Park," said the child, settling a scarlet poppy in the blue coat.

410
00:36:51,410 --> 00:36:57,070
"Thanks, Miss Lillian, I'll wear your colors with all my heart, especially today, for it is my birthday."

411
00:36:57,070 --> 00:37:02,760
And Paul looked up at the blooming little face with unusual softness in his keen blue eyes.

412
00:37:02,760 --> 00:37:04,090
"Is it?

413
00:37:04,090 --> 00:37:07,550
Why, then, you're seventeen; almost a man, aren't you?"

414
00:37:07,550 --> 00:37:11,650
"Yes, thank heaven," muttered the boy, half to himself.

415
00:37:11,650 --> 00:37:13,230
"I wish I was as old.

416
00:37:13,230 --> 00:37:15,370
I shan't be in my teens till autumn.

417
00:37:15,370 --> 00:37:21,050
I must give you something, Paul, because I like you very much, and you are always doing kind things for me.

418
00:37:21,050 --> 00:37:21,860
What shall it be?"

419
00:37:21,860 --> 00:37:27,370
And the child held out her hand with a cordial look and gesture that touched the boy.

420
00:37:27,370 --> 00:37:42,160
With one of the foreign fashions which sometimes appeared when he forgot himself, he kissed the small hand, saying impulsively, "My dear little mistress, I want nothing but your goodwillâ€”and your forgiveness," he added, under his breath.

421
00:37:42,160 --> 00:37:46,170
"You have that already, Paul, and I shall find something to add to it.

422
00:37:46,170 --> 00:37:47,590
But what is that?"

423
00:37:47,590 --> 00:37:53,270
And she laid hold of a little locket which had slipped into sight as Paul bent forward in his salute.

424
00:37:53,270 --> 00:38:01,340
He thrust it back, coloring so deeply that the child observed it, and exclaimed, with a mischievous laugh, "It is your sweetheart, Paul.

425
00:38:01,340 --> 00:38:06,840
I heard Bessy, my maid, tell Hester she was sure you had one because you took no notice of them.

426
00:38:06,840 --> 00:38:07,970
Let me see it.

427
00:38:07,970 --> 00:38:10,020
Is she pretty?"

428
00:38:10,020 --> 00:38:13,230
"Very pretty," answered the boy, without showing the picture.

429
00:38:13,230 --> 00:38:15,070
"Do you like her very much?"

430
00:38:15,070 --> 00:38:18,840
questioned Lillian, getting interested in the little romance.

431
00:38:18,840 --> 00:38:22,620
"Very much," and Paul's black eyelashes fell.

432
00:38:22,620 --> 00:38:25,760
"Would you die for her, as they say in the old songs?"

433
00:38:25,760 --> 00:38:28,020
asked the girl, melodramatically.

434
00:38:28,020 --> 00:38:32,090
"Yes, Miss Lillian, or live for her, which is harder."

435
00:38:32,090 --> 00:38:38,160
"Dear me, how very nice it must be to have anyone care for one so much," said the child innocently.

436
00:38:38,160 --> 00:38:40,700
"I wonder if anybody ever will for me?"

437
00:38:40,700 --> 00:38:48,380
"Love comes to all soon or late, And maketh gay or sad; For every bird will find its mate, And every lass a lad,"

438
00:38:48,380 --> 00:38:54,510
sang Paul, quoting one of Hester's songs, and looking relieved that Lillian's thoughts had strayed from him.

439
00:38:54,510 --> 00:38:56,620
But he was mistaken.

440
00:38:56,620 --> 00:38:59,730
"Shall you marry this sweetheart of yours someday?"

441
00:38:59,730 --> 00:39:04,190
asked Lillian, turning to him with a curious yet wistful look.

442
00:39:04,190 --> 00:39:05,890
"Perhaps."

443
00:39:05,890 --> 00:39:15,490
"You look as if there was no 'perhaps' about it," said the child, quick to read the kindling of the eye and the change in the voice that accompanied the boy's reply.

444
00:39:15,490 --> 00:39:21,550
"She is very young and I must wait, and while I wait many things may happen to part us."

445
00:39:21,550 --> 00:39:23,530
"Is she a lady?"

446
00:39:23,530 --> 00:39:28,110
"Yes, a wellborn, lovely little lady, and I'll marry her if I live."

447
00:39:28,110 --> 00:39:36,220
Paul spoke with a look of decision, and a proud lift of the head that contrasted curiously with the badge of servitude he wore.

448
00:39:36,220 --> 00:39:45,630
Lillian felt this, and asked, with a sudden shyness coming over her, "But you are a gentleman, and so no one will mind even if you are not rich."

449
00:39:45,630 --> 00:39:47,490
"How do you know what I am?"

450
00:39:47,490 --> 00:39:49,210
he asked quickly.

451
00:39:49,210 --> 00:39:56,170
"I heard Hester tell the housekeeper that you were not what you seemed, and one day she hoped you'd get your right place again.

452
00:39:56,170 --> 00:40:03,140
I asked Mamma about it, and she said she would not let me be with you so much if you were not a fit companion for me.

453
00:40:03,140 --> 00:40:09,210
I was not to speak of it, but she means to be your friend and help you by-and-by."

454
00:40:09,210 --> 00:40:10,760
"Does she?"

455
00:40:10,760 --> 00:40:24,410
And the boy laughed an odd, short laugh that jarred on Lillian's ear and made her say reprovingly, "You are proud, I know, but you'll let us help you because we like to do it, and I have no brother to share my money with."

456
00:40:24,410 --> 00:40:27,080
"Would you like one, or a sister?"

457
00:40:27,080 --> 00:40:30,920
asked Paul, looking straight into her face with his piercing eyes.

458
00:40:30,920 --> 00:40:32,470
"Yes, indeed!

459
00:40:32,470 --> 00:40:36,030
I long for someone to be with me and love me, as Mamma can't."

460
00:40:36,030 --> 00:40:44,520
"Would you be willing to share everything with another personâ€”perhaps have to give them a great many things you like and now have all to yourself?"

461
00:40:44,520 --> 00:40:46,190
"I think I should.

462
00:40:46,190 --> 00:40:54,160
I'm selfish, I know, because everyone pets and spoils me, but if I loved a person dearly I'd give up anything to them.

463
00:40:54,160 --> 00:40:57,330
Indeed I would, Paul, pray believe me."

464
00:40:57,330 --> 00:41:02,160
She spoke earnestly, and leaned on his shoulder as if to enforce her words.

465
00:41:02,160 --> 00:41:14,940
The boy's arm stole around the little figure in the saddle, and a beautiful bright smile broke over his face as he answered warmly, "I do believe it, dear, and it makes me happy to hear you say so.

466
00:41:14,940 --> 00:41:21,860
Don't be afraid, I'm your equal, but I'll not forget that you are my little mistress till I can change from groom to gentleman."

467
00:41:21,860 --> 00:41:32,020
He added the last sentence as he withdrew his arm, for Lillian had shrunk a little and blushed with surprise, not anger, at this first breach of respect on the part of her companion.

468
00:41:32,020 --> 00:41:38,460
Both were silent for a moment, Paul looking down and Lillian busy with her nosegay.

469
00:41:38,460 --> 00:41:43,350
She spoke first, assuming an air of satisfaction as she surveyed her work.

470
00:41:43,350 --> 00:41:49,260
"That will please Mamma, I'm sure, and make her quite forget my naughty prank of yesterday.

471
00:41:49,260 --> 00:41:54,350
Do you know I offended her dreadfully by peeping into the gold case she wears on her neck?

472
00:41:54,350 --> 00:41:57,030
She was asleep and I was sitting by her.

473
00:41:57,030 --> 00:42:01,690
In her sleep she pulled it out and said something about a letter and Papa.

474
00:42:01,690 --> 00:42:15,670
I wanted to see Papa's face, for I never did, because the big picture of him is gone from the gallery where the others are, so I peeped into the case when she let it drop and was so disappointed to find nothing but a key."

475
00:42:15,670 --> 00:42:16,930
"A key!

476
00:42:16,930 --> 00:42:18,310
What sort of a key?"

477
00:42:18,310 --> 00:42:20,530
cried Paul in an eager tone.

478
00:42:20,530 --> 00:42:26,160
"Oh, a little silver one like the key of my piano, or the black cabinet.

479
00:42:26,160 --> 00:42:29,460
She woke and was very angry to find me meddling."

480
00:42:29,460 --> 00:42:31,220
"What did it belong to?"

481
00:42:31,220 --> 00:42:32,470
asked Paul.

482
00:42:32,470 --> 00:42:41,330
"Her treasure box, she said, but I don't know where or what that is, and I dare not ask any more, for she forbade my speaking to her about it.

483
00:42:41,330 --> 00:42:42,430
Poor Mamma!

484
00:42:42,430 --> 00:42:45,240
I'm always troubling her in some way or other."

485
00:42:45,240 --> 00:42:50,660
With a penitent sigh, Lillian tied up her flowers and handed them to Paul to carry.

486
00:42:50,660 --> 00:42:53,590
As she did so, the change in his face struck her.

487
00:42:53,590 --> 00:42:56,600
"How grim and old you look," she exclaimed.

488
00:42:56,600 --> 00:42:58,980
"Have I said anything that troubles you?"

489
00:42:58,980 --> 00:43:00,560
"No, Miss Lillian.

490
00:43:00,560 --> 00:43:02,290
I'm only thinking."

491
00:43:02,290 --> 00:43:09,740
"Then I wish you wouldn't think, for you get a great wrinkle in your forehead, your eyes grow almost black, and your mouth looks fierce.

492
00:43:09,740 --> 00:43:17,690
You are a very odd person, Paul; one minute as gay as any boy, and the next as grave and stern as a man with a deal of work to do."

493
00:43:17,690 --> 00:43:22,450
"I have got a deal of work to do, so no wonder I look old and grim."

494
00:43:22,450 --> 00:43:24,380
"What work, Paul?"

495
00:43:24,380 --> 00:43:27,280
"To make my fortune and win my lady."

496
00:43:27,280 --> 00:43:35,610
When Paul spoke in that tone and wore that look, Lillian felt as if they had changed places, and he was the master and she the servant.

497
00:43:35,610 --> 00:43:47,210
She wondered over this in her childish mind, but proud and willful as she was, she liked it, and obeyed him with unusual meekness when he suggested that it was time to return.

498
00:43:47,210 --> 00:43:57,220
As he rode silently beside her, she stole covert glances at him from under her wide hat brim, and studied his unconscious face as she had never done before.

499
00:43:57,220 --> 00:44:07,830
His lips moved now and then but uttered no audible sound, his black brows were knit, and once his hand went to his breast as if he thought of the little sweetheart whose picture lay there.

500
00:44:07,830 --> 00:44:10,260
He's got a trouble.

501
00:44:10,260 --> 00:44:13,390
I wish he'd tell me and let me help him if I can.

502
00:44:13,390 --> 00:44:21,180
I'll make him show me that miniature someday, for I'm interested in that girl, thought Lillian with a pensive sigh.

503
00:44:21,180 --> 00:44:32,150
As he held his hand for her little foot in dismounting her at the hall door, Paul seemed to have shaken off his grave mood, for he looked up and smiled at her with his blithest expression.

504
00:44:32,150 --> 00:44:45,710
But Lillian appeared to be the thoughtful one now and with an air of dignity, very pretty and becoming, thanked her young squire in a stately manner and swept into the house, looking tall and womanly in her flowing skirts.

505
00:44:45,710 --> 00:44:57,680
Paul laughed as he glanced after her and, flinging himself onto his horse, rode away to the stables at a reckless pace, as if to work off some emotion for which he could find no other vent.

506
00:44:57,680 --> 00:45:01,520
"Here's a letter for you, lad, all the way from some place in Italy.

507
00:45:01,520 --> 00:45:03,030
Who do you know there?"

508
00:45:03,030 --> 00:45:05,500
said Bedford, as the boy came back.

509
00:45:05,500 --> 00:45:17,940
With a hasty "Thank you," Paul caught the letter and darted away to his own room, there to tear it open and, after reading a single line, to drop into a chair as if he had received a sudden blow.

510
00:45:17,940 --> 00:45:27,280
Growing paler and paler he read on, and when the letter fell from his hands he exclaimed, in a tone of despair, "How could he die at such a time!"

511
00:45:27,280 --> 00:45:34,930
For an hour the boy sat thinking intently, with locked door, curtained window, and several papers strewn before him.

512
00:45:34,930 --> 00:45:44,960
Letters, memoranda, plans, drawings, and bits of parchment, all of which he took from a small locked portfolio always worn about him.

513
00:45:44,960 --> 00:45:52,070
Over these he pored with a face in which hope, despondency, resolve, and regret alternated rapidly.

514
00:45:52,070 --> 00:45:59,640
Taking the locket out he examined a ring which lay in one side, and the childish face which smiled on him from the other.

515
00:45:59,640 --> 00:46:05,810
His eyes filled as he locked and put it by, saying tenderly, "Dear little heart!

516
00:46:05,810 --> 00:46:08,940
I'll not forget or desert her whatever happens.

517
00:46:08,940 --> 00:46:12,440
Time must help me, and to time I must leave my work.

518
00:46:12,440 --> 00:46:14,650
One more attempt and then I'm off."

519
00:46:14,650 --> 00:46:19,770
"I'll go to bed now, Hester; but while you get my things ready I'll take a turn in the corridor.

520
00:46:19,770 --> 00:46:21,670
The air will refresh me."

521
00:46:21,670 --> 00:46:31,920
As she spoke, Lady Trevlyn drew her wrapper about her and paced softly down the long hall lighted only by fitful gleams of moonlight and the ruddy glow of the fire.

522
00:46:31,920 --> 00:46:45,680
At the far end was the state chamber, never used now, and never visited except by Hester, who occasionally went in to dust and air it, and my lady, who always passed the anniversary of Sir Richard's death alone there.

523
00:46:45,680 --> 00:46:56,640
The gallery was very dark, and she seldom went farther than the last window in her restless walks, but as she now approached she was startled to see a streak of yellow light under the door.

524
00:46:56,640 --> 00:47:01,600
She kept the key herself and neither she nor Hester had been there that day.

525
00:47:01,600 --> 00:47:10,980
A cold shiver passed over her for, as she looked, the shadow of a foot darkened the light for a moment and vanished as if someone had noiselessly passed.

526
00:47:10,980 --> 00:47:15,920
Obeying a sudden impulse, my lady sprang forward and tried to open the door.

527
00:47:15,920 --> 00:47:23,070
It was locked, but as her hand turned the silver knob a sound as if a drawer softly closed met her ear.

528
00:47:23,070 --> 00:47:28,100
She stooped to the keyhole but it was dark, a key evidently being in the lock.

529
00:47:28,100 --> 00:47:35,460
She drew back and flew to her room, snatched the key from her dressing table, and, bidding Hester follow, returned to the hall.

530
00:47:35,460 --> 00:47:38,030
"What is it, my lady?"

531
00:47:38,030 --> 00:47:41,520
cried the woman, alarmed at the agitation of her mistress.

532
00:47:41,520 --> 00:47:44,640
"A light, a sound, a shadow in the state chamber.

533
00:47:44,640 --> 00:47:45,600
Come quick!"

534
00:47:45,600 --> 00:47:51,510
cried Lady Trevlyn, adding, as she pointed to the door, "There, there, the light shines underneath.

535
00:47:51,510 --> 00:47:52,780
Do you see it?"

536
00:47:52,780 --> 00:47:56,530
"No, my lady, it's dark," returned Hester.

537
00:47:56,530 --> 00:48:05,810
It was, but never pausing my lady thrust in the key, and to her surprise it turned, the door flew open, and the dim, still room was before them.

538
00:48:05,810 --> 00:48:20,530
Hester boldly entered, and while her mistress slowly followed, she searched the room, looking behind the tall screen by the hearth, up the wide chimney, in the great wardrobe, and under the ebony cabinet, where all the relics of Sir Richard were kept.

539
00:48:20,530 --> 00:48:25,840
Nothing appeared, not even a mouse, and Hester turned to my lady with an air of relief.

540
00:48:25,840 --> 00:48:33,630
But her mistress pointed to the bed shrouded in dark velvet hangings, and whispered breathlessly, "You forgot to look there."

541
00:48:33,630 --> 00:48:43,520
Hester had not forgotten, but in spite of her courage and good sense she shrank a little from looking at the spot where she had last seen her master's dead face.

542
00:48:43,520 --> 00:48:51,190
She believed the light and sound to be phantoms of my lady's distempered fancy, and searched merely to satisfy her.

543
00:48:51,190 --> 00:48:59,120
The mystery of Sir Richard's death still haunted the minds of all who remembered it, and even Hester felt a superstitious dread of that room.

544
00:48:59,120 --> 00:49:07,340
With a nervous laugh she looked under the bed and, drawing back the heavy curtains, said soothingly, "You see, my lady, there's nothing there."

545
00:49:07,340 --> 00:49:22,260
But the words died on her lips, for, as the pale glimmer of the candle pierced the gloom of that funeral couch, both saw a face upon the pillow: a pale face framed in dark hair and beard, with closed eyes and the stony look the dead wear.

546
00:49:22,260 --> 00:49:36,070
A loud, long shriek that roused the house broke from Lady Trevlyn as she fell senseless at the bedside, and dropping both curtain and candle Hester caught up her mistress and fled from the haunted room, locking the door behind her.

547
00:49:36,070 --> 00:49:44,680
In a moment a dozen servants were about them, and into their astonished ears Hester poured her story while vainly trying to restore her lady.

548
00:49:44,680 --> 00:49:54,780
Great was the dismay and intense the unwillingness of anyone to obey when Hester ordered the men to search the room again, for she was the first to regain her self-possession.

549
00:49:54,780 --> 00:49:56,390
"Where's Paul?

550
00:49:56,390 --> 00:50:01,620
He's the heart of a man, boy though he is," she said angrily as the men hung back.

551
00:50:01,620 --> 00:50:03,530
"He's not here.

552
00:50:03,530 --> 00:50:03,910
Lord!

553
00:50:03,910 --> 00:50:10,090
Maybe it was him a-playing tricks, though it ain't like him," cried Bessy, Lillian's little maid.

554
00:50:10,090 --> 00:50:12,460
"No, it can't be him, for I locked him in myself.

555
00:50:12,460 --> 00:50:16,380
He walks in his sleep sometimes, and I was afraid he'd startle my lady.

556
00:50:16,380 --> 00:50:20,690
Let him sleep; this would only excite him and set him to marching again.

557
00:50:20,690 --> 00:50:25,040
Follow me, Bedford and James, I'm not afraid of ghosts or rogues."

558
00:50:25,040 --> 00:50:33,340
With a face that belied her words Hester led the way to the awful room, and flinging back the curtain resolutely looked in.

559
00:50:33,340 --> 00:50:40,900
The bed was empty, but on the pillow was plainly visible the mark of a head and a single scarlet stain, as of blood.

560
00:50:40,900 --> 00:50:52,110
At that sight Hester turned pale and caught the butler's arm, whispering with a shudder, "Do you remember the night we put him in his coffin, the drop of blood that fell from his white lips?

561
00:50:52,110 --> 00:50:54,250
Sir Richard has been here."

562
00:50:54,250 --> 00:50:56,560
"Good Lord, ma'am, don't say that!

563
00:50:56,560 --> 00:51:02,660
We can never rest in our beds if such things are to happen," gasped Bedford, backing to the door.

564
00:51:02,660 --> 00:51:18,750
"It's no use to look, we've found all we shall find so go your ways and tell no one of this," said the woman in a gloomy tone, and, having assured herself that the windows were fast, Hester locked the room and ordered everyone but Bedford and the housekeeper to bed.

565
00:51:18,750 --> 00:51:31,280
"Do you sit outside my lady's door till morning," she said to the butler, "and you, Mrs. Price, help me to tend my poor lady, for if I'm not mistaken this night's work will bring on the old trouble."

566
00:51:31,280 --> 00:51:43,000
Morning came, and with it a new alarm; for, though his door was fast locked and no foothold for even a sparrow outside the window, Paul's room was empty, and the boy nowhere to be found.

Chapter 5

572
00:52:01,430 --> 00:52:03,190
A HERO

573
00:52:03,190 --> 00:52:15,470
Four years had passed, and Lillian was fast blooming into a lovely woman: proud and willful as ever, but very charming, and already a belle in the little world where she still reigned a queen.

574
00:52:15,470 --> 00:52:30,230
Owing to her mother's ill health, she was allowed more freedom than is usually permitted to an English girl of her age; and, during the season, often went into company with a friend of Lady Trevlyn's who was chaperoning two young daughters of her own.

575
00:52:30,230 --> 00:52:39,960
To the world Lillian seemed a gay, free-hearted girl; and no one, not even her mother, knew how well she remembered and how much she missed the lost Paul.

576
00:52:39,960 --> 00:52:45,370
No tidings of him had ever come, and no trace of him was found after his flight.

577
00:52:45,370 --> 00:52:52,620
Nothing was missed, he went without his wages, and no reason could be divined for his departure except the foreign letter.

578
00:52:52,620 --> 00:52:59,360
Bedford remembered it, but forgot what postmark it bore, for he had only been able to decipher "Italy."

579
00:52:59,360 --> 00:53:09,970
My lady made many inquiries and often spoke of him; but when month after month passed and no news came, she gave him up, and on Lillian's account feigned to forget him.

580
00:53:09,970 --> 00:53:23,610
Contrary to Hester's fear, she did not seem the worse for the nocturnal fright, but evidently connected the strange visitor with Paul, or, after a day or two of nervous exhaustion, returned to her usual state of health.

581
00:53:23,610 --> 00:53:34,800
Hester had her own misgivings, but, being forbidden to allude to the subject, she held her peace, after emphatically declaring that Paul would yet appear to set her mind at rest.

582
00:53:34,800 --> 00:53:37,660
"Lillian, Lillian, I've such news for you!

583
00:53:37,660 --> 00:53:41,520
Come and hear a charming little romance, and prepare to see the hero of it!"

584
00:53:41,520 --> 00:53:48,310
cried Maud Churchill, rushing into her friend's pretty boudoir one day in the height of the season.

585
00:53:48,310 --> 00:53:57,870
Lillian lay on a couch, rather languid after a ball, and listlessly begged Maud to tell her story, for she was dying to be amused.

586
00:53:57,870 --> 00:54:02,520
"Well my, dear, just listen and you'll be as enthusiastic as I am," cried Maud.

587
00:54:02,520 --> 00:54:10,390
And throwing her bonnet on one chair, her parasol on another, and her gloves anywhere, she settled herself on the couch and began: "

588
00:54:10,390 --> 00:54:20,230
You remember reading in the papers, some time ago, that fine account of the young man who took part in the Italian revolution and did that heroic thing with the bombshell?"

589
00:54:20,230 --> 00:54:21,860
"Yes, what of him?"

590
00:54:21,860 --> 00:54:24,210
asked Lillian, sitting up.

591
00:54:24,210 --> 00:54:27,350
"He is my hero, and we are to see him tonight."

592
00:54:27,350 --> 00:54:28,790
"Go on, go on!

593
00:54:28,790 --> 00:54:31,910
Tell all, and tell it quickly," she cried.

594
00:54:31,910 --> 00:54:38,700
"You know the officers were sitting somewhere, holding a council, while the city (I forget the name) was being bombarded,

595
00:54:38,700 --> 00:54:48,680
and how a shell came into the midst of them, how they sat paralyzed, expecting it to burst, and how this young man caught it up and ran out with it, risking his own life to save theirs?"

596
00:54:48,680 --> 00:54:50,910
"Yes, yes, I remember!"

597
00:54:50,910 --> 00:54:54,460
And Lillian's listless face kindled at the recollection.

598
00:54:54,460 --> 00:55:01,840
"Well, an Englishman who was there was so charmed by the act that, finding the young man was poor and an orphan, he adopted him.

599
00:55:01,840 --> 00:55:08,670
Mr. Talbot was old, and lonely, and rich, and when he died, a year after, he left his name and fortune to this Paolo."

600
00:55:08,670 --> 00:55:10,510
"I'm glad, I'm glad!"

601
00:55:10,510 --> 00:55:13,740
cried Lillian, clapping her hands with a joyful face.

602
00:55:13,740 --> 00:55:16,020
"How romantic and charming it is!"

603
00:55:16,020 --> 00:55:17,240
"Isn't it?

604
00:55:17,240 --> 00:55:20,740
But, my dear creature, the most romantic part is to come.

605
00:55:20,740 --> 00:55:25,710
Young Talbot served in the war, and then came to England to take possession of his property.

606
00:55:25,710 --> 00:55:31,930
It's somewhere down in Kent, a fine place and good income, all his; and he deserves it.

607
00:55:31,930 --> 00:55:37,300
Mamma heard a deal about him from Mrs. Langdon, who knew old Talbot and has seen the young man.

608
00:55:37,300 --> 00:55:43,650
Of course all the girls are wild to behold him, for he is very handsome and accomplished, and a gentleman by birth.

609
00:55:43,650 --> 00:55:55,810
But the dreadful part is that he is already betrothed to a lovely Greek girl, who came over at the same time, and is living in London with a companion; quite elegantly, Mrs. Langdon says, for she called and was charmed.

610
00:55:55,810 --> 00:56:03,220
This girl has been seen by some of our gentlemen friends, and they already rave about the 'fair Helene,' for that's her name."

611
00:56:03,220 --> 00:56:08,260
Here Maud was forced to stop for breath, and Lillian had a chance to question her.

612
00:56:08,260 --> 00:56:09,810
"How old is she?"

613
00:56:09,810 --> 00:56:12,890
"About eighteen or nineteen, they say."

614
00:56:12,890 --> 00:56:14,540
"Very pretty?"

615
00:56:14,540 --> 00:56:18,670
"Ravishing, regularly Greek and divine, Fred Raleigh says."

616
00:56:18,670 --> 00:56:20,560
"When is she to be married?"

617
00:56:20,560 --> 00:56:24,060
"Don't know; when Talbot gets settled, I fancy."

618
00:56:24,060 --> 00:56:25,110
"And he?

619
00:56:25,110 --> 00:56:27,220
Is he as charming as she?"

620
00:56:27,220 --> 00:56:29,610
"Quite, I'm told.

621
00:56:29,610 --> 00:56:34,610
He's just of age, and is, in appearance as in everything else, a hero of romance."

622
00:56:34,610 --> 00:56:38,570
"How came your mother to secure him for tonight?"

623
00:56:38,570 --> 00:56:42,190
"Mrs. Langdon is dying to make a lion of him, and begged to bring him.

624
00:56:42,190 --> 00:56:46,760
He is very indifferent on such things and seems intent on his own affairs.

625
00:56:46,760 --> 00:56:57,130
Is grave and old for his years, and doesn't seem to care much for pleasure and admiration, as most men would after a youth like his, for he has had a hard time, I believe.

626
00:56:57,130 --> 00:57:04,330
For a wonder, he consented to come when Mrs. Langdon asked him, and I flew off at once to tell you and secure you for tonight."

627
00:57:04,330 --> 00:57:06,090
"A thousand thanks.

628
00:57:06,090 --> 00:57:12,340
I meant to rest, for Mamma frets about my being so gay; but she won't object to a quiet evening with you.

629
00:57:12,340 --> 00:57:13,700
What shall we wear?"

630
00:57:13,700 --> 00:57:19,220
And here the conversation branched off on the all-absorbing topic of dress.

631
00:57:19,220 --> 00:57:27,740
When Lillian joined her friend that evening, the hero had already arrived, and, stepping into a recess, she waited to catch a glimpse of him.

632
00:57:27,740 --> 00:57:34,100
Maud was called away, and she was alone when the crowd about the inner room thinned and permitted young Talbot to be seen.

633
00:57:34,100 --> 00:57:45,580
Well for Lillian that no one observed her at that moment, for she grew pale and sank into a chair, exclaiming below her breath, "It is Paulâ€”my Paul!"

634
00:57:45,580 --> 00:57:51,600
She recognized him instantly, in spite of increased height, a dark moustache, and martial bearing.

635
00:57:51,600 --> 00:58:04,390
It was Paul, older, graver, handsomer, but still "her Paul," as she called him, with a flush of pride and delight as she watched him, and felt that of all there she knew him best and loved him most.

636
00:58:04,390 --> 00:58:12,780
For the childish affection still existed, and this discovery added a tinge of romance that made it doubly dangerous as well as doubly pleasant.

637
00:58:12,780 --> 00:58:14,040
Will he know me?

638
00:58:14,040 --> 00:58:30,180
she thought, glancing at a mirror which reflected a slender figure with bright hair, white arms, and brilliant eyes; a graceful little head, proudly carried, and a sweet mouth, just then very charming, as it smiled till pearly teeth shone between the ruddy lips.

639
00:58:30,180 --> 00:58:43,210
I'm glad I'm not ugly, and I hope he'll like me, she thought, as she smoothed the golden ripples on her forehead, settled her sash, and shook out the folds of her airy dress in a flutter of girlish excitement.

640
00:58:43,210 --> 00:58:58,030
"I'll pretend not to know him, when we meet, and see what he will do," she said, with a wicked sense of power; for being forewarned she was forearmed, and, fearing no betrayal of surprise on her own part, was eager to enjoy any of which he might be guilty.

641
00:58:58,030 --> 00:59:03,860
Leaving her nook, she joined a group of young friends and held herself prepared for the meeting.

642
00:59:03,860 --> 00:59:10,820
Presently she saw Maud and Mrs. Langdon approaching, evidently intent on presenting the hero to the heiress.

643
00:59:10,820 --> 00:59:14,520
"Mr. Talbot, Miss Trevlyn," said the lady.

644
00:59:14,520 --> 00:59:22,360
And looking up with a well-assumed air of indifference, Lillian returned the gentleman's bow with her eyes fixed full upon his face.

645
00:59:22,360 --> 00:59:29,860
Not a feature of that face changed, and so severely unconscious of any recognition was it that the girl was bewildered.

646
00:59:29,860 --> 00:59:45,940
For a moment she fancied she had been mistaken in his identity, and a pang of disappointment troubled her; but as he moved a chair for Maud, she saw on the one ungloved hand a little scar which she remembered well, for he received it in saving her from a dangerous fall.

647
00:59:45,940 --> 00:59:53,340
At the sight all the happy past rose before her, and if her telltale eyes had not been averted they would have betrayed her.

648
00:59:53,340 --> 01:00:02,380
A sudden flush of maidenly shame dyed her cheek as she remembered that last ride, and the childish confidences then interchanged.

649
01:00:02,380 --> 01:00:10,850
This Helen was the little sweetheart whose picture he wore, and now, in spite of all obstacles, he had won both fortune and ladylove.

650
01:00:10,850 --> 01:00:19,450
The sound of his voice recalled her thoughts, and glancing up she met the deep eyes fixed on her with the same steady look they used to wear.

651
01:00:19,450 --> 01:00:28,480
He had addressed her, but what he said she knew not, beyond a vague idea that it was some slight allusion to the music going on in the next room.

652
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:43,480
With a smile which would serve for an answer to almost any remark, she hastily plunged into conversation with a composure that did her credit in the eyes of her friends, who stood in awe of the young hero, for all were but just out.

653
01:00:43,480 --> 01:00:51,110
"Mr. Talbot hardly needs an introduction here, for his name is well-known among us, though this is perhaps his first visit to England?"

654
01:00:51,110 --> 01:00:57,160
she said, flattering herself that this artful speech would entrap him into the reply she wanted.

655
01:00:57,160 --> 01:01:09,380
With a slight frown, as if the allusion to his adventure rather annoyed him, and a smile that puzzled all but Lillian, he answered very simply, "It is not my first visit to this hospitable island.

656
01:01:09,380 --> 01:01:14,110
I was here a few years ago, for a short time, and left with regret."

657
01:01:14,110 --> 01:01:16,170
"Then you have old friends here?"

658
01:01:16,170 --> 01:01:18,640
And Lillian watched him as she spoke.

659
01:01:18,640 --> 01:01:20,040
"I had.

660
01:01:20,040 --> 01:01:26,780
They had doubtless forgotten me now," he said, with a sudden shadow marring the tranquillity of his face.

661
01:01:26,780 --> 01:01:28,430
"Why doubt them?

662
01:01:28,430 --> 01:01:31,390
If they were true friends, they will not forget."

663
01:01:31,390 --> 01:01:40,780
The words were uttered impulsively, almost warmly, but Talbot made no response, except a polite inclination and an abrupt change in the conversation.

664
01:01:40,780 --> 01:01:43,440
"That remains to be proved.

665
01:01:43,440 --> 01:01:45,280
Do you sing, Miss Trevlyn?"

666
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,400
"A little."

667
01:01:46,400 --> 01:01:49,370
And Lillian's tone was both cold and proud.

668
01:01:49,370 --> 01:01:56,340
"A great deal, and very charmingly," added Maud, who took pride in her friend's gifts both of voice and beauty.

669
01:01:56,340 --> 01:01:59,710
"Come, dear, there are so few of us you will sing, I know.

670
01:01:59,710 --> 01:02:02,810
Mamma desired me to ask you when Edith had done."

671
01:02:02,810 --> 01:02:07,420
To her surprise Lillian complied, and allowed Talbot to lead her to the instrument.

672
01:02:07,420 --> 01:02:18,460
Still hoping to win some sign of recognition from him, the girl chose an air he taught her and sang it with a spirit and skill that surprised the listeners who possessed no key to her mood.

673
01:02:18,460 --> 01:02:27,020
At the last verse her voice suddenly faltered, but Talbot took up the song and carried her safely through it with his well-tuned voice.

674
01:02:27,020 --> 01:02:28,730
"You know the air then?"

675
01:02:28,730 --> 01:02:33,410
she said in a low tone, as a hum of commendation followed the music.

676
01:02:33,410 --> 01:02:42,180
"All Italians sing it, though few do it like yourself," he answered quietly, restoring the fan he had held while standing beside her.

677
01:02:42,180 --> 01:02:43,860
Provoking boy!

678
01:02:43,860 --> 01:02:45,170
why won't he know me?

679
01:02:45,170 --> 01:02:45,950
thought Lillian.

680
01:02:45,950 --> 01:02:49,990
And her tone was almost petulant as she refused to sing again.

681
01:02:49,990 --> 01:02:58,040
Talbot offered his arm and led her to a seat, behind which stood a little statuette of a child holding a fawn by a daisy chain.

682
01:02:58,040 --> 01:02:59,650
"Pretty, isn't it?"

683
01:02:59,650 --> 01:03:04,140
she said, as he paused to look at it instead of taking the chair before her.

684
01:03:04,140 --> 01:03:10,240
"I used to enjoy modeling tiny deer and hinds in wax, as well as making daisy chains.

685
01:03:10,240 --> 01:03:14,920
Is sculpture among the many accomplishments which rumor tells us you possess?"

686
01:03:14,920 --> 01:03:16,230
"No.

687
01:03:16,230 --> 01:03:24,820
Those who, like me, have their own fortunes to mold find time for little else," he answered gravely, still examining the marble group.

688
01:03:24,820 --> 01:03:39,340
Lillian broke her fan with an angry flirt, for she was tired of her trial, and wished she had openly greeted him at the beginning; feeling now how pleasant it would have been to sit chatting of old times, while her friends dared hardly address him at all.

689
01:03:39,340 --> 01:03:46,340
She was on the point of calling him by his former name, when the remembrance of what he had been arrested the words on her lips.

690
01:03:46,340 --> 01:03:52,820
He was proud; would he not dread to have it known that, in his days of adversity, he had been a servant?

691
01:03:52,820 --> 01:03:58,490
For if she betrayed her knowledge of his past, she would be forced to tell where and how that knowledge was gained.

692
01:03:58,490 --> 01:04:05,980
No, better wait till they met alone, she thought; he would thank her for her delicacy, and she could easily explain her motive.

693
01:04:05,980 --> 01:04:14,110
He evidently wished to seem a stranger, for once she caught a gleam of the old, mirthful mischief in his eye, as she glanced up unexpectedly.

694
01:04:14,110 --> 01:04:19,760
He did remember her, she was sure, yet was trying her, perhaps, as she tried him.

695
01:04:19,760 --> 01:04:23,350
Well, she would stand the test and enjoy the joke by-and-by.

696
01:04:23,350 --> 01:04:36,590
With this fancy in her head she assumed a gracious air and chatted away in her most charming style, feeling both gay and excited, so anxious was she to please, and so glad to recover her early friend.

697
01:04:36,590 --> 01:04:46,150
A naughty whim seized her as her eye fell on a portfolio of classical engravings which someone had left in disorder on a table near her.

698
01:04:46,150 --> 01:04:56,120
Tossing them over she asked his opinion of several, and then handed him one in which Helen of Troy was represented as giving her hand to the irresistible Paris.

699
01:04:56,120 --> 01:05:00,440
"Do you think her worth so much bloodshed, and deserving so much praise?"

700
01:05:00,440 --> 01:05:07,220
she asked, vainly trying to conceal the significant smile that would break loose on her lips and sparkle in her eyes.

701
01:05:07,220 --> 01:05:21,740
Talbot laughed the short, boyish laugh so familiar to her ears, as he glanced from the picture to the arch questioner, and answered in a tone that made her heart beat with a nameless pain and pleasure, so full of suppressed ardor was it:

702
01:05:21,740 --> 01:05:22,840
"Yes!

703
01:05:22,840 --> 01:05:27,100
'All for love or the world well lost' is a saying I heartily agree to.

704
01:05:27,100 --> 01:05:32,760
La belle Helene is my favorite heroine, and I regard Paris as the most enviable of men."

705
01:05:32,760 --> 01:05:34,740
"I should like to see her."

706
01:05:34,740 --> 01:05:43,770
The wish broke from Lillian involuntarily, and she was too much confused to turn it off by any general expression of interest in the classical lady.

707
01:05:43,770 --> 01:05:58,280
"You may sometime," answered Talbot, with an air of amusement; adding, as if to relieve her, "I have a poetical belief that all the lovely women of history or romance will meet, and know, and love each other in some charming hereafter."

708
01:05:58,280 --> 01:06:06,760
"But I'm no heroine and no beauty, so I shall never enter your poetical paradise," said Lillian, with a pretty affectation of regret.

709
01:06:06,760 --> 01:06:12,770
"Some women are beauties without knowing it, and the heroines of romances never given to the world.

710
01:06:12,770 --> 01:06:15,350
I think you and Helen will yet meet, Miss Trevlyn."

711
01:06:15,350 --> 01:06:28,130
As he spoke, Mrs. Langdon beckoned, and he left her pondering over his last words, and conscious of a secret satisfaction in his implied promise that she should see his betrothed.

712
01:06:28,130 --> 01:06:29,720
"How do you like him?"

713
01:06:29,720 --> 01:06:32,640
whispered Maud, slipping into the empty chair.

714
01:06:32,640 --> 01:06:39,330
"Very well," was the composed reply; for Lillian enjoyed her little mystery too much to spoil it yet.

715
01:06:39,330 --> 01:06:40,920
"What did you say to him?

716
01:06:40,920 --> 01:06:46,590
I longed to hear, for you seemed to enjoy yourselves very much, but I didn't like to be a marplot."

717
01:06:46,590 --> 01:06:56,330
Lillian repeated a part of the conversation, and Maud professed to be consumed with jealousy at the impression her friend had evidently made.

718
01:06:56,330 --> 01:07:06,320
"It is folly to try to win the hero, for he is already won, you know," answered Lillian, shutting the cover on the pictured Helen with a sudden motion as if glad to extinguish her.

719
01:07:06,320 --> 01:07:16,280
"Oh dear, no; Mrs. Langdon just told Mamma that she was mistaken about their being engaged; for she asked him and he shook his head, saying Helen was his ward."

720
01:07:16,280 --> 01:07:19,940
"But that is absurd, for he's only a boy himself.

721
01:07:19,940 --> 01:07:21,780
It's very odd, isn't it?

722
01:07:21,780 --> 01:07:24,860
Never mind, I shall soon know all about it."

723
01:07:24,860 --> 01:07:26,040
"How?"

724
01:07:26,040 --> 01:07:29,210
cried Maud, amazed at Lillian's assured manner.

725
01:07:29,210 --> 01:07:32,990
"Wait a day or two and, I'll tell you a romance in return for yours.

726
01:07:32,990 --> 01:07:36,370
Your mother beckons to me, so I know Hester has come.

727
01:07:36,370 --> 01:07:37,480
Good night.

728
01:07:37,480 --> 01:07:39,310
I've had a charming time."

729
01:07:39,310 --> 01:07:43,020
And with this tantalizing adieu, Lillian slipped away.

730
01:07:43,020 --> 01:07:52,800
Hester was waiting in the carriage, but as Lillian appeared, Talbot put aside the footman and handed her in, saying very low, in the well-remembered tone:

731
01:07:52,800 --> 01:07:55,680
"Good night, my little mistress."

Chapter 6

737
01:08:15,820 --> 01:08:17,200
FAIR HELEN

738
01:08:17,200 --> 01:08:23,230
To no one but her mother and Hester did Lillian confide the discovery she had made.

739
01:08:23,230 --> 01:08:31,660
None of the former servants but old Bedford remained with them, and till Paul chose to renew the old friendship it was best to remain silent.

740
01:08:31,660 --> 01:08:42,580
Great was the surprise and delight of our lady and Hester at the good fortune of their protege, and many the conjectures as to how he would explain his hasty flight.

741
01:08:42,580 --> 01:08:47,240
"You will go and see him, won't you, Mamma, or at least inquire about him?"

742
01:08:47,240 --> 01:08:54,390
said Lillian, eager to assure the wanderer of a welcome, for those few words of his had satisfied her entirely.

743
01:08:54,390 --> 01:09:00,390
"No, dear, it is for him to seek us, and till he does, I shall make no sign.

744
01:09:00,390 --> 01:09:06,250
He knows where we are, and if he chooses he can renew the acquaintance so strangely broken off.

745
01:09:06,250 --> 01:09:17,840
Be patient, and above all things remember, Lillian, that you are no longer a child," replied my lady, rather disturbed by her daughter's enthusiastic praises of Paul.

746
01:09:17,840 --> 01:09:23,790
"I wish I was, for then I might act as I feel, and not be afraid of shocking the proprieties."

747
01:09:23,790 --> 01:09:26,870
And Lillian went to bed to dream of her hero.

748
01:09:26,870 --> 01:09:35,570
For three days she stayed at home, expecting Paul, but he did not come, and she went out for her usual ride in the Park, hoping to meet him.

749
01:09:35,570 --> 01:09:44,290
An elderly groom now rode behind her, and she surveyed him with extreme disgust, as she remembered the handsome lad who had once filled that place.

750
01:09:44,290 --> 01:09:53,480
Nowhere did Paul appear, but in the Ladies' Mile she passed an elegant brougham in which sat a very lovely girl and a mild old lady.

751
01:09:53,480 --> 01:09:57,580
"That is Talbot's fiancee," said Maud Churchill, who had joined her.

752
01:09:57,580 --> 01:09:59,390
"Isn't she beautiful?"

753
01:09:59,390 --> 01:10:07,780
"Not at allâ€”yes, very," was Lillian's somewhat peculiar reply, for jealousy and truth had a conflict just then.

754
01:10:07,780 --> 01:10:15,490
"He's so perfectly absorbed and devoted that I am sure that story is true, so adieu to our hopes," laughed Maud.

755
01:10:15,490 --> 01:10:17,070
"Did you have any?

756
01:10:17,070 --> 01:10:18,790
Good-bye, I must go."

757
01:10:18,790 --> 01:10:23,440
And Lillian rode home at a pace which caused the stout groom great distress.

758
01:10:23,440 --> 01:10:26,050
"Mamma, I've seen Paul's betrothed!"

759
01:10:26,050 --> 01:10:29,120
she cried, running into her mother's boudoir.

760
01:10:29,120 --> 01:10:38,250
"And I have seen Paul himself," replied my lady, with a warning look, for there he stood, with half-extended hand, as if waiting to be acknowledged.

761
01:10:38,250 --> 01:10:49,800
Lillian forgot her embarrassment in her pleasure, and made him an elaborate curtsy, saying, with a half-merry, half-reproachful glance, "Mr. Talbot is welcome in whatever guise he appears."

762
01:10:49,800 --> 01:10:57,970
"I choose to appear as Paul, then, and offer you a seat, Miss Lillian," he said, assuming as much of his boyish manner as he could.

763
01:10:57,970 --> 01:11:05,920
Lillian took it and tried to feel at ease, but the difference between the lad she remembered and the man she now saw was too great to be forgotten.

764
01:11:05,920 --> 01:11:18,080
"Now tell us your adventures, and why you vanished away so mysteriously four years ago," she said, with a touch of the childish imperiousness in her voice, though her frank eyes fell before his.

765
01:11:18,080 --> 01:11:23,760
"I was about to do so when you appeared with news concerning my cousin," he began.

766
01:11:23,760 --> 01:11:24,920
"Your cousin!"

767
01:11:24,920 --> 01:11:26,640
exclaimed Lillian.

768
01:11:26,640 --> 01:11:29,910
"Yes, Helen's mother and my own were sisters.

769
01:11:29,910 --> 01:11:34,650
Both married Englishmen, both died young, leaving us to care for each other.

770
01:11:34,650 --> 01:11:40,090
We were like a brother and sister, and always together till I left her to serve Colonel Daventry.

771
01:11:40,090 --> 01:11:46,110
The death of the old priest to whom I entrusted her recalled me to Genoa, for I was then her only guardian.

772
01:11:46,110 --> 01:11:55,760
I meant to have taken leave of you, my lady, properly, but the consequences of that foolish trick of mine frightened me away in the most unmannerly fashion."

773
01:11:55,760 --> 01:12:03,980
"Ah, it was you, then, in the state chamber; I always thought so," and Lady Trevlyn drew a long breath of relief.

774
01:12:03,980 --> 01:12:11,990
"Yes, I heard it whispered among the servants that the room was haunted, and I felt a wish to prove the truth of the story and my own courage.

775
01:12:11,990 --> 01:12:20,160
Hester locked me in, for fear of my sleepwalking; but I lowered myself by a rope and then climbed in at the closet window of the state chamber.

776
01:12:20,160 --> 01:12:27,860
When you came, my lady, I thought it was Hester, and slipped into the bed, meaning to give her a fright in return for her turning the key on me.

777
01:12:27,860 --> 01:12:34,190
But when your cry showed me what I had done, I was filled with remorse, and escaped as quickly and quietly as possible.

778
01:12:34,190 --> 01:12:42,290
I should have asked pardon before; I do now, most humbly, my lady, for it was sacrilege to play pranks there."

779
01:12:42,290 --> 01:12:51,800
During the first part of his story Paul's manner had been frank and composed, but in telling the latter part, his demeanor underwent a curious change.

780
01:12:51,800 --> 01:13:02,170
He fixed his eyes on the ground and spoke as if repeating a lesson, while his color varied, and a half-proud, half-submissive expression replaced the former candid one.

781
01:13:02,170 --> 01:13:16,480
Lillian observed this, and it disturbed her, but my lady took it for shame at his boyish freak and received his confession kindly, granting a free pardon and expressing sincere pleasure at his amended fortunes.

782
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:31,220
As he listened, Lillian saw him clench his hand hard and knit his brows, assuming the grim look she had often seen, as if trying to steel himself against some importunate emotion or rebellious thought.

783
01:13:31,220 --> 01:13:43,190
"Yes, half my work is done, and I have a home, thanks to my generous benefactor, and I hope to enjoy it well and wisely," he said in a grave tone, as if the fortune had not yet brought him his heart's desire.

784
01:13:43,190 --> 01:13:46,420
"And when is the other half of the work to be accomplished, Paul?

785
01:13:46,420 --> 01:13:48,890
That depends on your cousin, perhaps."

786
01:13:48,890 --> 01:13:54,740
And Lady Trevlyn regarded him with a gleam of womanly curiosity in her melancholy eyes.

787
01:13:54,740 --> 01:13:58,240
"It does, but not in the way you fancy, my lady.

788
01:13:58,240 --> 01:14:01,770
Whatever Helen may be, she is not my fiancee yet, Miss Lillian."

789
01:14:01,770 --> 01:14:11,160
And the shadow lifted as he laughed, looking at the young lady, who was decidedly abashed, in spite of a sense of relief caused by his words.

790
01:14:11,160 --> 01:14:16,510
"I merely accepted the world's report," she said, affecting a nonchalant air.

791
01:14:16,510 --> 01:14:21,430
"The world is a liar, as you will find in time" was his abrupt reply.

792
01:14:21,430 --> 01:14:24,280
"I hope to see this beautiful cousin, Paul.

793
01:14:24,280 --> 01:14:26,940
Will she receive us as old friends of yours?"

794
01:14:26,940 --> 01:14:29,360
"Thanks, not yet, my lady.

795
01:14:29,360 --> 01:14:33,870
She is still too much a stranger here to enjoy new faces, even kind ones.

796
01:14:33,870 --> 01:14:39,510
I have promised perfect rest and freedom for a time, but you shall be the first whom she receives."

797
01:14:39,510 --> 01:14:46,250
Again Lillian detected the secret disquiet which possessed him, and her curiosity was roused.

798
01:14:46,250 --> 01:14:55,280
It piqued her that this Helen felt no desire to meet her and chose to seclude herself, as if regardless of the interest and admiration she excited.

799
01:14:55,280 --> 01:15:00,310
"I will see her in spite of her refusal, for I only caught a glimpse in the Park.

800
01:15:00,310 --> 01:15:06,140
Something is wrong, and I'll discover it, for it evidently worries Paul, and perhaps I can help him."

801
01:15:06,140 --> 01:15:15,610
As this purpose sprang up in the warm but willful heart of the girl, she regained her spirits and was her most charming self while the young man stayed.

802
01:15:15,610 --> 01:15:26,840
They talked of many things in a pleasant, confidential manner, though when Lillian recalled that hour, she was surprised to find how little Paul had really told them of his past life or future plans.

803
01:15:26,840 --> 01:15:42,620
It was agreed among them to say nothing of their former relations, except to old Bedford, who was discretion itself, but to appear to the world as new-made friendsâ€”thus avoiding unpleasant and unnecessary explanations which would only excite gossip.

804
01:15:42,620 --> 01:15:59,650
My lady asked him to dine, but he had business out of town and declined, taking his leave with a lingering look, which made Lillian steal away to study her face in the mirror and wonder if she looked her best, for in Paul's eyes she had read undisguised admiration.

805
01:15:59,650 --> 01:16:07,060
Lady Trevlyn went to her room to rest, leaving the girl free to ride, drive, or amuse herself as she liked.

806
01:16:07,060 --> 01:16:15,880
As if fearing her courage would fail if she delayed, Lillian ordered the carriage, and, bidding Hester mount guard over her, she drove away to St.

807
01:16:15,880 --> 01:16:17,100
John's Wood.

808
01:16:17,100 --> 01:16:28,110
"Now, Hester, don't lecture or be prim when I tell you that we are going on a frolic," she began, after getting the old woman into an amiable mood by every winning wile she could devise.

809
01:16:28,110 --> 01:16:31,630
"I think you'll like it, and if it's found out I'll take the blame.

810
01:16:31,630 --> 01:16:36,080
There is some mystery about Paul's cousin, and I'm going to find it out."

811
01:16:36,080 --> 01:16:38,270
"Bless you, child, how?"

812
01:16:38,270 --> 01:16:43,160
"She lives alone here, is seldom seen, and won't go anywhere or receive anyone.

813
01:16:43,160 --> 01:16:45,440
That's not natural in a pretty girl.

814
01:16:45,440 --> 01:16:51,070
Paul won't talk about her, and, though he's fond of her, he always looks grave and grim when I ask questions.

815
01:16:51,070 --> 01:16:53,590
That's provoking, and I won't hear it.

816
01:16:53,590 --> 01:17:06,780
Maud is engaged to Raleigh, you know; well, he confided to her that he and a friend had found out where Helen was, had gone to the next villa, which is empty, and under pretense of looking at it got a peep at the girl in her garden.

817
01:17:06,780 --> 01:17:08,720
I'm going to do the same."

818
01:17:08,720 --> 01:17:11,060
"And what am I to do?"

819
01:17:11,060 --> 01:17:17,610
asked Hester, secretly relishing the prank, for she was dying with curiosity to behold Paul's cousin.

820
01:17:17,610 --> 01:17:21,950
"You are to do the talking with the old woman, and give me a chance to look.

821
01:17:21,950 --> 01:17:26,040
Now say you will, and I'll behave myself like an angel in return."

822
01:17:26,040 --> 01:17:39,220
Hester yielded, after a few discreet scruples, and when they reached Laburnum Lodge played her part so well that Lillian soon managed to stray away into one of the upper rooms which overlooked the neighboring garden.

823
01:17:39,220 --> 01:17:43,200
Helen was there, and with eager eyes the girl scrutinized her.

824
01:17:43,200 --> 01:17:55,690
She was very beautiful, in the classical style; as fair and finely molded as a statue, with magnificent dark hair and eyes, and possessed of that perfect grace which is as effective as beauty.

825
01:17:55,690 --> 01:18:06,180
She was alone, and when first seen was bending over a flower which she caressed and seemed to examine with great interest as she stood a long time motionless before it.

826
01:18:06,180 --> 01:18:18,220
Then she began to pace slowly around and around the little grass plot, her hands hanging loosely clasped before her, and her eyes fixed on vacancy as if absorbed in thought.

827
01:18:18,220 --> 01:18:24,870
But as the first effect of her beauty passed away, Lillian found something peculiar about her.

828
01:18:24,870 --> 01:18:38,330
It was not the somewhat foreign dress and ornaments she wore; it was in her face, her movements, and the tone of her voice, for as she walked she sang a low, monotonous song, as if unconsciously.

829
01:18:38,330 --> 01:18:51,300
Lillian watched her keenly, marking the aimless motions of the little hands, the apathy of the lovely face, and the mirthless accent of the voice; but most of all the vacant fixture of the great dark eyes.

830
01:18:51,300 --> 01:18:58,670
Around and around she went, with an elastic step and a mechanical regularity wearisome to witness.

831
01:18:58,670 --> 01:19:00,720
What is the matter with her?

832
01:19:00,720 --> 01:19:07,130
thought Lillian anxiously, as this painful impression increased with every scrutiny of the unconscious girl.

833
01:19:07,130 --> 01:19:13,950
So abashed was she that Hester's call was unheard, and Hester was unseen as she came and stood beside her.

834
01:19:13,950 --> 01:19:25,100
Both looked a moment, and as they looked an old lady came from the house and led Helen in, still murmuring her monotonous song and moving her hands as if to catch and hold the sunshine.

835
01:19:25,100 --> 01:19:27,650
"Poor dear, poor dear.

836
01:19:27,650 --> 01:19:35,140
No wonder Paul turns sad and won't talk of her, and that she don't see anyone," sighed Hester pitifully.

837
01:19:35,140 --> 01:19:36,930
"What is it?

838
01:19:36,930 --> 01:19:41,320
I see, but don't understand," whispered Lillian.

839
01:19:41,320 --> 01:19:47,730
"She's an innocent, deary, an idiot, though that's a hard word for a pretty creature like her."

840
01:19:47,730 --> 01:19:49,150
"How terrible!

841
01:19:49,150 --> 01:19:52,240
Come away, Hester, and never breathe to anyone what we have seen."

842
01:19:52,240 --> 01:20:01,930
And with a shudder and sense of pain and pity lying heavy at her heart, she hurried away, feeling doubly guilty in the discovery of this affliction.

843
01:20:01,930 --> 01:20:12,510
The thought of it haunted her continually; the memory of the lonely girl gave her no peace; and a consciousness of deceit burdened her unspeakably, especially in Paul's presence.

844
01:20:12,510 --> 01:20:21,880
This lasted for a week, then Lillian resolved to confess, hoping that when he found she knew the truth he would let her share his cross and help to lighten it.

845
01:20:21,880 --> 01:20:30,150
Waiting her opportunity, she seized a moment when her mother was absent, and with her usual frankness spoke out impetuously.

846
01:20:30,150 --> 01:20:34,900
"Paul, I've done wrong, and I can have no peace till I am pardoned.

847
01:20:34,900 --> 01:20:36,860
I have seen Helen."

848
01:20:36,860 --> 01:20:39,240
"Where, when, and how?"

849
01:20:39,240 --> 01:20:41,770
he asked, looking disturbed and yet relieved.

850
01:20:41,770 --> 01:20:52,420
She told him rapidly, and as she ended she looked up at him with her sweet face, so full of pity, shame, and grief it would have been impossible to deny her anything.

851
01:20:54,040 --> 01:20:57,080
"Can you forgive me for discovering this affliction?"

852
01:20:57,080 --> 01:21:03,770
"I think I could forgive you a far greater fault, Lillian," he answered, in a tone that said many things.

853
01:21:03,770 --> 01:21:10,270
"But deceit is so mean, so dishonorable and contemptible, how can you so easily pardon it in me?"

854
01:21:10,270 --> 01:21:16,160
she asked, quite overcome by this forgiveness, granted without any reproach.

855
01:21:16,160 --> 01:21:20,120
"Then you would find it hard to pardon such a thing in another?"

856
01:21:20,120 --> 01:21:23,390
he said, with the expression that always puzzled her.

857
01:21:23,390 --> 01:21:28,730
"Yes, it would be hard; but in those I loved, I could forgive much for love's sake."

858
01:21:28,730 --> 01:21:34,170
With a sudden gesture he took her hand saying, impulsively, "How little changed you are!

859
01:21:34,170 --> 01:21:37,720
Do you remember that last ride of ours nearly five years ago?"

860
01:21:37,720 --> 01:21:41,090
"Yes, Paul," she answered, with averted eyes.

861
01:21:41,090 --> 01:21:43,160
"And what we talked of?"

862
01:21:43,160 --> 01:21:46,680
"A part of that childish gossip I remember well."

863
01:21:46,680 --> 01:21:48,320
"Which part?"

864
01:21:48,320 --> 01:21:51,320
"The pretty little romance you told me."

865
01:21:51,320 --> 01:21:57,170
And Lillian looked up now, longing to ask if Helen's childhood had been blighted like her youth.

866
01:21:57,170 --> 01:22:06,280
Paul dropped her hand as if he, read her thoughts, and his own hand went involuntarily toward his breast, betraying that the locket still hung there.

867
01:22:06,280 --> 01:22:07,950
"What did I say?"

868
01:22:07,950 --> 01:22:11,070
he asked, smiling at her sudden shyness.

869
01:22:11,070 --> 01:22:15,510
"You vowed you'd win and wed your fair little lady-love if you lived."

870
01:22:15,510 --> 01:22:19,950
"And so I will," he cried, with sudden fire in his eyes.

871
01:22:19,950 --> 01:22:21,610
"What, marry her?"

872
01:22:21,610 --> 01:22:23,520
"Aye, that I will."

873
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:33,110
"Oh Paul, will you tie yourself for life to aâ€”" The word died on her lips, but a gesture of repugnance finished the speech.

874
01:22:33,110 --> 01:22:34,520
"A what?"

875
01:22:34,520 --> 01:22:36,370
he demanded, excitedly.

876
01:22:36,370 --> 01:22:43,900
"An innocent, one bereft of reason," stammered Lillian, entirely forgetting herself in her interest for him.

877
01:22:43,900 --> 01:22:45,590
"Of whom do you speak?"

878
01:22:45,590 --> 01:22:48,100
asked Paul, looking utterly bewildered,

879
01:22:48,100 --> 01:22:49,900
"Of poor Helen."

880
01:22:49,900 --> 01:22:52,890
"Good heavens, who told you that base lie?"

881
01:22:52,890 --> 01:22:56,190
And his voice deepened with indignant pain.

882
01:22:56,190 --> 01:23:02,440
"I saw her, you did not deny her affliction; Hester said so, and I believed it.

883
01:23:02,440 --> 01:23:04,620
Have I wronged her, Paul?"

884
01:23:04,620 --> 01:23:06,740
"Yes, cruelly.

885
01:23:06,740 --> 01:23:09,810
She is blind, but no idiot, thank God."

886
01:23:09,810 --> 01:23:24,200
There was such earnestness in his voice, such reproach in his words, and such ardor in his eye, that Lillian's pride gave way, and with a broken entreaty for pardon, she covered up her face, weeping the bitterest tears she ever shed.

887
01:23:24,200 --> 01:23:31,000
For in that moment, and the sharp pang it brought her, she felt how much she loved Paul and how hard it was to lose him.

888
01:23:31,000 --> 01:23:41,490
The childish affection had blossomed into a woman's passion, and in a few short weeks had passed through many phases of jealousy, hope, despair, and self-delusion.

889
01:23:41,490 --> 01:23:55,030
The joy she felt on seeing him again, the pride she took in him, the disgust Helen caused her, the relief she had not dared to own even to herself, when she fancied fate had put an insurmountable barrier between Paul and his cousin,

890
01:23:55,030 --> 01:24:09,790
the despair at finding it only a fancy, and the anguish of hearing him declare his unshaken purpose to marry his first loveâ€”all these conflicting emotions had led to this hard moment, and now self-control deserted her in her need.

891
01:24:09,790 --> 01:24:21,500
In spite of her efforts the passionate tears would have their way, though Paul soothed her with assurances of entire forgiveness, promises of Helen's friendship, and every gentle device he could imagine.

892
01:24:21,500 --> 01:24:32,950
She commanded herself at last by a strong effort, murmuring eagerly as she shrank from the hand that put back her fallen hair, and the face so full of tender sympathy bending over her:

893
01:24:32,950 --> 01:24:36,820
"I am so grieved and ashamed at what I have said and done.

894
01:24:36,820 --> 01:24:38,480
I shall never dare to see Helen.

895
01:24:38,480 --> 01:24:40,450
Forgive me, and forget this folly.

896
01:24:40,450 --> 01:24:48,950
I'm sad and heavyhearted just now; it's the anniversary of Papa's death, and Mamma always suffers so much at such times that I get nervous."

897
01:24:48,950 --> 01:24:50,580
"It is your birthday also.

898
01:24:50,580 --> 01:24:56,070
I remembered it, and ventured to bring a little token in return for the one you gave me long ago.

899
01:24:56,070 --> 01:25:00,570
This is a talisman, and tomorrow I will tell you the legend concerning it.

900
01:25:00,570 --> 01:25:03,950
Wear it for my sake, and God bless you, dear."

901
01:25:03,950 --> 01:25:13,340
The last words were whispered hurriedly; Lillian saw the glitter of an antique ring, felt the touch of bearded lips on her hand, and Paul was gone.

902
01:25:13,340 --> 01:25:22,060
But as he left the house he set his teeth, examining low to himself, "Yes, tomorrow there will be an end of this!

903
01:25:22,060 --> 01:25:25,030
We must risk everything and abide the consequences now.

904
01:25:25,030 --> 01:25:28,260
I'll have no more torment for any of us."

905

910
01:25:46,940 --> 01:25:48,630
THE SECRET KEY

911
01:25:48,630 --> 01:25:51,140
"Is Lady Trevlyn at home, Bedford?"

912
01:25:51,140 --> 01:25:59,290
asked Paul, as he presented himself at an early hour next day, wearing the keen, stern expression which made him look ten years older than he was.

913
01:25:59,290 --> 01:26:03,670
"No, sir, my lady and Miss Lillian went down to the Hall last night."

914
01:26:03,670 --> 01:26:05,480
"No ill news, I hope?"

915
01:26:05,480 --> 01:26:09,570
And the young man's eye kindled as if he felt a crisis at hand.

916
01:26:09,570 --> 01:26:11,500
"Not that I heard, sir.

917
01:26:11,500 --> 01:26:21,410
Miss Lillian took one of her sudden whims and would have gone alone, if my lady hadn't given in much against her will, this being a time when she is better away from the place."

918
01:26:21,410 --> 01:26:23,900
"Did they leave no message for me?"

919
01:26:23,900 --> 01:26:25,010
"Yes, sir.

920
01:26:25,010 --> 01:26:27,320
Will you step in and read the note at your ease.

921
01:26:27,320 --> 01:26:30,740
We are in sad confusion, but this room is in order."

922
01:26:30,740 --> 01:26:35,290
Leading the way to Lillian's boudoir, the man presented the note and retired.

923
01:26:35,290 --> 01:26:42,230
A few hasty lines from my lady, regretting the necessity of this abrupt departure, yet giving no reason for it,

924
01:26:42,230 --> 01:26:52,950
hoping they might meet next season, but making no allusion to seeing him at the Hall, desiring Lillian's thanks and regards, but closing with no hint of Helen, except compliments.

925
01:26:52,950 --> 01:27:03,010
Paul smiled as he threw it into the fire, saying to himself, "Poor lady, she thinks she has escaped the danger by flying, and Lillian tries to hide her trouble from me.

926
01:27:03,010 --> 01:27:04,480
Tender little heart!

927
01:27:04,480 --> 01:27:06,640
I'll comfort it without delay."

928
01:27:06,640 --> 01:27:11,410
He sat looking about the dainty room still full of tokens of her presence.

929
01:27:11,410 --> 01:27:28,060
The piano stood open with a song he liked upon the rack; a bit of embroidery, whose progress he had often watched, lay in her basket with the little thimble near it; there was a strew of papers on the writing table, torn notes, scraps of drawing, and ball cards;

930
01:27:28,060 --> 01:27:35,200
a pearl-colored glove lay on the floor; and in the grate the faded flowers he had brought two days before.

931
01:27:35,200 --> 01:27:42,390
As his eye roved to and fro, he seemed to enjoy some happy dream, broken too soon by the sound of servants shutting up the house.

932
01:27:42,390 --> 01:27:48,300
He arose but lingered near the table, as if longing to search for some forgotten hint of himself.

933
01:27:48,300 --> 01:27:53,550
"No, there has been enough lock picking and stealthy work; I'll do no more for her sake.

934
01:27:53,550 --> 01:27:56,510
This theft will harm no one and tell no tales."

935
01:27:56,510 --> 01:27:59,580
And snatching up the glove, Paul departed.

936
01:27:59,580 --> 01:28:01,770
"Helen, the time has come.

937
01:28:01,770 --> 01:28:02,720
Are you ready?"

938
01:28:02,720 --> 01:28:05,390
he asked, entering her room an hour later.

939
01:28:05,390 --> 01:28:06,730
"I am ready."

940
01:28:06,730 --> 01:28:13,430
And rising, she stretched her hand to him with a proud expression, contrasting painfully with her helpless gesture.

941
01:28:13,430 --> 01:28:15,890
"They have gone to the Hall, and we must follow.

942
01:28:15,890 --> 01:28:24,150
It is useless to wait longer; we gain nothing by it, and the claim must stand on such proof as we have, or fall for want of that one link.

943
01:28:24,150 --> 01:28:25,890
I am tired of disguise.

944
01:28:25,890 --> 01:28:30,160
I want to be myself and enjoy what I have won, unless I lose it all."

945
01:28:30,160 --> 01:28:37,040
"Paul, whatever happens, remember we cling together and share good or evil fortune as we always have done.

946
01:28:37,040 --> 01:28:40,700
I am a burden, but I cannot live without you, for you are my world.

947
01:28:40,700 --> 01:28:42,560
Do not desert me."

948
01:28:42,560 --> 01:28:47,570
She groped her way to him and clung to his strong arm as if it was her only stay.

949
01:28:47,570 --> 01:29:00,350
Paul drew her close, saying wistfully, as he caressed the beautiful sightless face leaning on his shoulder, "Mia cara, would it break your heart, if at the last hour I gave up all and let the word remain unspoken?

950
01:29:00,350 --> 01:29:05,880
My courage fails me, and in spite of the hard past I would gladly leave them in peace."

951
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,960
"No, no, you shall not give it up!"

952
01:29:08,960 --> 01:29:15,770
cried Helen almost fiercely, while the slumbering fire of her southern nature flashed into her face.

953
01:29:15,770 --> 01:29:22,000
"You have waited so long, worked so hard, suffered so much, you must not lose your reward.

954
01:29:22,000 --> 01:29:24,910
You promised, and you must keep the promise."

955
01:29:24,910 --> 01:29:30,340
"But it is so beautiful, so noble to forgive, and return a blessing for a curse.

956
01:29:30,340 --> 01:29:34,100
Let us bury the old feud, and right the old wrong in a new way.

957
01:29:34,100 --> 01:29:38,910
Those two are so blameless, it is cruel to visit the sins of the dead on their innocent heads.

958
01:29:38,910 --> 01:29:46,680
My lady has suffered enough already, and Lillian is so young, so happy, so unfit to meet a storm like this.

959
01:29:46,680 --> 01:29:50,220
Oh, Helen, mercy is more divine than justice."

960
01:29:50,220 --> 01:29:57,330
Something moved Paul deeply, and Helen seemed about to yield, when the name of Lillian wrought a subtle change in her.

961
01:29:57,330 --> 01:30:09,560
The color died out of her face, her black eyes burned with a gloomy fire, and her voice was relentless as she answered, while her frail hands held him fast, "I will not let you give it up.

962
01:30:09,560 --> 01:30:16,350
We are as innocent as they; we have suffered more; and we deserve our rights, for we have no sin to expiate.

963
01:30:16,350 --> 01:30:20,420
Go on, Paul, and forget the sentimental folly that unmans you."

964
01:30:20,420 --> 01:30:23,890
Something in her words seemed to sting or wound him.

965
01:30:23,890 --> 01:30:29,370
His face darkened, and he put her away, saying briefly, "Let it be so then.

966
01:30:29,370 --> 01:30:31,860
In an hour we must go."

967
01:30:31,860 --> 01:30:38,320
On the evening of the same day, Lady Trevlyn and her daughter sat together in the octagon room at the Hall.

968
01:30:38,320 --> 01:30:53,720
Twilight was falling and candles were not yet brought, but a cheery fire blazed in the wide chimney, filling the apartment with a ruddy glow, turning Lillian's bright hair to gold and lending a tinge of color to my lady's pallid cheeks.

969
01:30:53,720 --> 01:31:03,210
The girl sat on a low lounging chair before the fire, her head on her hands, her eyes on the red embers, her thoughtsâ€”where?

970
01:31:03,210 --> 01:31:14,020
My lady lay on her couch, a little in the shadow, regarding her daughter with an anxious air, for over the young face a somber change had passed which filled her with disquiet.

971
01:31:14,020 --> 01:31:23,520
"You are out of spirits, love," she said at last, breaking the long silence, as Lillian gave an unconscious sigh and leaned wearily into the depths of the chair.

972
01:31:23,520 --> 01:31:25,890
"Yes, Mamma, a little."

973
01:31:25,890 --> 01:31:27,140
"What is it?

974
01:31:27,140 --> 01:31:28,230
Are you ill?"

975
01:31:28,230 --> 01:31:32,200
"No, Mamma; I think London gaiety is rather too much for me.

976
01:31:32,200 --> 01:31:35,860
I'm too young for it, as you often say, and I've found it out."

977
01:31:35,860 --> 01:31:41,360
"Then it is only weariness that makes you so pale and grave, and so bent on coming back here?"

978
01:31:41,360 --> 01:31:48,640
Lillian was the soul of truth, and with a moment's hesitation answered slowly, "Not that alone, Mamma.

979
01:31:48,640 --> 01:31:50,850
I'm worried about other things.

980
01:31:50,850 --> 01:31:53,380
Don't ask me what, please."

981
01:31:53,380 --> 01:31:55,130
"But I must ask.

982
01:31:55,130 --> 01:31:57,070
Tell me, child, what things?

983
01:31:57,070 --> 01:31:58,430
Have you seen any one?

984
01:31:58,430 --> 01:32:02,480
Had letters, or been annoyed in any way aboutâ€”anything?"

985
01:32:02,480 --> 01:32:09,770
My lady spoke with sudden energy and rose on her arm, eyeing the girl with unmistakable suspicion and excitement.

986
01:32:09,770 --> 01:32:19,380
"No, Mamma, it's only a foolish trouble of my own," answered Lillian, with a glance of surprise and a shamefaced look as the words reluctantly left her lips.

987
01:32:19,380 --> 01:32:22,450
"Ah, a love trouble, nothing more?

988
01:32:22,450 --> 01:32:23,950
Thank God for that!"

989
01:32:23,950 --> 01:32:27,320
And my lady sank back as if a load was off her mind.

990
01:32:27,320 --> 01:32:31,710
"Tell me all, my darling; there is no confidante like a mother."

991
01:32:31,710 --> 01:32:38,350
"You are very kind, and perhaps you can cure my folly if I tell it, and yet I am ashamed," murmured the girl.

992
01:32:38,350 --> 01:32:48,380
Then yielding to an irresistible impulse to ask help and sympathy, she added, in an almost inaudible tone, "I came away to escape from Paul."

993
01:32:48,380 --> 01:32:50,700
"Because he loves you, Lillian?"

994
01:32:50,700 --> 01:32:53,890
asked my lady, with a frown and a half smile.

995
01:32:53,890 --> 01:32:56,800
"Because he does not love me, Mamma."

996
01:32:56,800 --> 01:33:05,830
And the poor girl hid her burning cheeks in her hands, as if overwhelmed with maidenly shame at the implied confession of her own affection.

997
01:33:05,830 --> 01:33:07,970
"My child, how is this?

998
01:33:07,970 --> 01:33:13,730
I cannot but be glad that he does not love you; yet it fills me with grief to see that this pains you.

999
01:33:13,730 --> 01:33:15,780
He is not a mate for you, Lillian.

1000
01:33:15,780 --> 01:33:22,020
Remember this, and forget the transient regard that has sprung up from that early intimacy of yours."

1001
01:33:22,020 --> 01:33:34,930
"He is wellborn, and now my equal in fortune, and oh, so much my superior in all gifts of mind and heart," sighed the girl, still with hidden face, for tears were dropping through her slender fingers.

1002
01:33:34,930 --> 01:33:41,650
"It may be, but there is a mystery about him; and I have a vague dislike to him in spite of all that has passed.

1003
01:33:41,650 --> 01:33:44,490
But, darling, are you sure he does not care for you?

1004
01:33:44,490 --> 01:33:54,140
I fancied I read a different story in his face, and when you begged to leave town so suddenly, I believed that you had seen this also, and kindly wished to spare him any pain."

1005
01:33:54,140 --> 01:33:57,450
"It was to spare myself.

1006
01:33:57,450 --> 01:34:01,330
Oh, Mamma, he loves Helen, and will marry her although she is blind.

1007
01:34:01,330 --> 01:34:08,910
He told me this, with a look I could not doubt, and so I came away to hide my sorrow," sobbed poor Lillian in despair.

1008
01:34:08,910 --> 01:34:24,520
Lady Trevlyn went to her and, laying the bright head on her motherly bosom, said soothingly as she caressed it, "My little girl, it is too soon for you to know these troubles, and I am punished for yielding to your entreaties for a peep at the gay world.

1009
01:34:24,520 --> 01:34:30,000
It is now too late to spare you this; you have had your wish and must pay its price, dear.

1010
01:34:30,000 --> 01:34:33,550
But, Lillian, call pride to aid you, and conquer this fruitless love.

1011
01:34:33,550 --> 01:34:40,160
It cannot be very deep as yet, for you have known Paul, the man, too short a time to be hopelessly enamored.

1012
01:34:40,160 --> 01:34:48,630
Remember, there are others, better, braver, more worthy of you; that life is long, and full of pleasure yet untried."

1013
01:34:48,630 --> 01:34:50,880
"Have no fears for me, Mamma.

1014
01:34:50,880 --> 01:34:54,560
I'll not disgrace you or myself by any sentimental folly.

1015
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,380
I do love Paul, but I can conquer it, and I will.

1016
01:34:58,380 --> 01:35:02,730
Give me a little time, and you shall see me quite myself again."

1017
01:35:02,730 --> 01:35:11,590
Lillian lifted her head with an air of proud resolve that satisfied her mother, and with a grateful kiss stole away to ease her full heart alone.

1018
01:35:11,590 --> 01:35:23,680
As she disappeared Lady Trevlyn drew a long breath and, clasping her hands with a gesture of thanksgiving, murmured to herself in an accent of relief, "Only a love sorrow!

1019
01:35:23,680 --> 01:35:26,310
I feared it was some new terror like the old one.

1020
01:35:26,310 --> 01:35:37,130
Seventeen years of silence, seventeen years of secret dread and remorse for me," she said, pacing the room with tightly locked hands and eyes full of unspeakable anguish.

1021
01:35:37,130 --> 01:35:38,860
"Oh, Richard, Richard!

1022
01:35:38,860 --> 01:35:44,970
I forgave you so long ago, and surely I have expiated my innocent offense by these years of suffering!

1023
01:35:44,970 --> 01:35:49,050
For her sake I did it, and for her sake I still keep dumb.

1024
01:35:49,050 --> 01:35:53,640
God knows I ask nothing for myself but rest and oblivion by your side."

1025
01:35:53,640 --> 01:35:56,720
Half an hour later, Paul stood at the hall door.

1026
01:35:56,720 --> 01:36:03,290
It was ajar, for the family had returned unexpectedly, as was evident from the open doors and empty halls.

1027
01:36:03,290 --> 01:36:08,130
Entering unseen, he ascended to the room my lady usually occupied.

1028
01:36:08,130 --> 01:36:18,610
The fire burned low, Lillian's chair was empty, and my lady was asleep, as if lulled by the sighing winds without and the deep silence that reigned within.

1029
01:36:18,610 --> 01:36:30,090
Paul stood regarding her with a great pity softening his face as he marked the sunken eyes, pallid cheeks, locks too early gray, and restless lips muttering in dreams.

1030
01:36:30,090 --> 01:36:34,830
"I wish I could spare her this," he sighed, stooping to wake her with a word.

1031
01:36:34,830 --> 01:36:46,830
But he did not speak, for, suddenly clutching the chain about her neck, she seemed to struggle with some invisible foe and beat it off, muttering audibly as she clenched her thin hands on the golden case.

1032
01:36:46,830 --> 01:36:57,940
Paul leaned and listened as if the first word had turned him to stone, till the paroxysm had passed, and with a heavy sigh my lady sank into a calmer sleep.

1033
01:36:57,940 --> 01:37:11,030
Then, with a quick glance over his shoulder, Paul skillfully opened the locket, drew out the silver key, replaced it with one from the piano close by, and stole from the house noiselessly as he had entered it.

1034
01:37:11,030 --> 01:37:18,700
That night, in the darkest hour before the dawn, a figure went gliding through the shadowy Park to its most solitary corner.

1035
01:37:18,700 --> 01:37:23,040
Here stood the tomb of the Trevlyns, and here the figure paused.

1036
01:37:23,040 --> 01:37:32,710
A dull spark of light woke in its hand, there was a clank of bars, the creak of rusty hinges, then light and figure both seemed swallowed up.

1037
01:37:32,710 --> 01:37:43,620
Standing in the tomb where the air was close and heavy, the pale glimmer of the lantern showed piles of moldering coffins in the niches, and everywhere lay tokens of decay and death.

1038
01:37:43,620 --> 01:37:55,850
The man drew his hat lower over his eyes, pulled the muffler closer about his mouth, and surveyed the spot with an undaunted aspect, though the beating of his heart was heard in the deep silence.

1039
01:37:55,850 --> 01:38:03,580
Nearest the door stood a long casket covered with black velvet and richly decorated with silver ornaments, tarnished now.

1040
01:38:03,580 --> 01:38:15,980
The Trevlyns had been a stalwart race, and the last sleeper brought there had evidently been of goodly stature, for the modern coffin was as ponderous as the great oaken beds where lay the bones of generations.

1041
01:38:15,980 --> 01:38:33,680
Lifting the lantern, the intruder brushed the dust from the shield-shaped plate, read the name RICHARD TREVLYN and a date, and, as if satisfied, placed a key in the lock, half-raised the lid, and, averting his head that he might not see the ruin seventeen long years had made,

1042
01:38:33,680 --> 01:38:40,020
he laid his hand on the dead breast and from the folded shroud drew a mildewed paper.

1043
01:38:40,020 --> 01:38:51,270
One glance sufficed, the casket was relocked, the door rebarred, the light extinguished, and the man vanished like a ghost in the darkness of the wild October night.

1044
01:38:51,270 --> 01:38:53,530

Chapter 8

1049
01:39:09,500 --> 01:39:10,810
WHICH?

1050
01:39:10,810 --> 01:39:12,920
"A Gentleman, my lady."

1051
01:39:12,920 --> 01:39:24,810
Taking a card from the silver salver on which the servant offered it, Lady Trevlyn read, "Paul Talbot," and below the name these penciled words, "I beseech you to see me."

1052
01:39:24,810 --> 01:39:27,650
Lillian stood beside her and saw the line.

1053
01:39:27,650 --> 01:39:36,450
Their eyes met, and in the girl's face was such a sudden glow of hope, and love, and longing, that the mother could not doubt or disappoint her wish.

1054
01:39:36,450 --> 01:39:39,060
"I will see him," she said.

1055
01:39:39,060 --> 01:39:41,120
"Oh, Mamma, how kind you are!"

1056
01:39:41,120 --> 01:39:46,480
cried the girl with a passionate embrace, adding breathlessly, "He did not ask for me.

1057
01:39:46,480 --> 01:39:47,950
I cannot see him yet.

1058
01:39:47,950 --> 01:39:53,720
I'll hide in the alcove, and can appear or run away as I like when we know why he comes."

1059
01:39:53,720 --> 01:40:03,380
They were in the library, for, knowing Lillian's fondness for the room which held no dark memories for her, my lady conquered her dislike and often sat there.

1060
01:40:03,380 --> 01:40:12,130
As she spoke, the girl glided into the deep recess of a bay window and drew the heavy curtains just as Paul's step sounded at the door.

1061
01:40:12,130 --> 01:40:18,130
Hiding her agitation with a woman's skill, my lady rose with outstretched hand to welcome him.

1062
01:40:18,130 --> 01:40:27,680
He bowed but did not take the hand, saying, in a voice of grave respect in which was audible an undertone of strong emotion, "Pardon me, Lady Trevlyn.

1063
01:40:27,680 --> 01:40:32,720
Hear what I have to say; and then if you offer me your hand, I shall gratefully receive it."

1064
01:40:32,720 --> 01:40:46,470
She glanced at him, and saw that he was very pale, that his eye glittered with suppressed excitement, and his whole manner was that of a man who had nerved himself up to the performance of a difficult but intensely interesting task.

1065
01:40:46,470 --> 01:40:57,420
Fancying these signs of agitation only natural in a young lover coming to woo, my lady smiled, reseated herself, and calmly answered, "I will listen patiently.

1066
01:40:57,420 --> 01:41:01,100
Speak freely, Paul, and remember I am an old friend."

1067
01:41:01,100 --> 01:41:03,300
"I wish I could forget it.

1068
01:41:03,300 --> 01:41:18,450
Then my task would be easier," he murmured in a voice of mingled regret and resolution, as he leaned on a tall chair opposite and wiped his damp forehead, with a look of such deep compassion that her heart sank with a nameless fear.

1069
01:41:18,450 --> 01:41:24,920
"I must tell you a long story, and ask your forgiveness for the offenses I committed against you when a boy.

1070
01:41:24,920 --> 01:41:29,160
A mistaken sense of duty guided me, and I obeyed it blindly.

1071
01:41:29,160 --> 01:41:33,000
Now I see my error and regret it," he said earnestly.

1072
01:41:33,000 --> 01:41:40,420
"Go on," replied my lady, while the vague dread grew stronger, and she braced her nerves as for some approaching shock.

1073
01:41:40,420 --> 01:41:47,330
She forgot Lillian, forgot everything but the strange aspect of the man before her, and the words to which she listened like a statue.

1074
01:41:47,330 --> 01:41:55,200
Still standing pale and steady, Paul spoke rapidly, while his eyes were full of mingled sternness, pity, and remorse.

1075
01:41:55,200 --> 01:42:01,810
"Twenty years ago, an English gentleman met a friend in a little Italian town, where he had married a beautiful wife.

1076
01:42:01,810 --> 01:42:11,930
The wife had a sister as lovely as herself, and the young man, during that brief stay, loved and married herâ€”in a very private manner, lest his father should disinherit him.

1077
01:42:11,930 --> 01:42:19,180
A few months passed, and the Englishman was called home to take possession of his title and estates, the father being dead.

1078
01:42:19,180 --> 01:42:22,990
He went alone, promising to send for the wife when all was ready.

1079
01:42:22,990 --> 01:42:29,770
He told no one of his marriage, meaning to surprise his English friends by producing the lovely woman unexpectedly.

1080
01:42:29,770 --> 01:42:41,890
He had been in England but a short time when he received a letter from the old priest of the Italian town, saying the cholera had swept through it, carrying off half its inhabitants, his wife and friend among others.

1081
01:42:41,890 --> 01:42:49,700
This blow prostrated the young man, and when he recovered he hid his grief, shut himself up in his country house, and tried to forget.

1082
01:42:49,700 --> 01:42:54,560
Accident threw in his way another lovely woman, and he married again.

1083
01:42:54,560 --> 01:43:02,180
Before the first year was out, the friend whom he supposed was dead appeared, and told him that his wife still lived, and had borne him a child.

1084
01:43:02,180 --> 01:43:08,820
In the terror and confusion of the plague, the priest had mistaken one sister for the other, as the elder did die."

1085
01:43:08,820 --> 01:43:11,700
"Yes, yes, I know; go on!"

1086
01:43:11,700 --> 01:43:16,730
gasped my lady, with white lips, and eyes that never left the narrator's face.

1087
01:43:16,730 --> 01:43:23,310
"This friend had met with misfortune after flying from the doomed village with the surviving sister.

1088
01:43:23,310 --> 01:43:30,820
They had waited long for letters, had written, and, when no answer came, had been delayed by illness and poverty from reaching England.

1089
01:43:30,820 --> 01:43:41,550
At this time the child was born, and the friend, urged by the wife and his own interest, came here, learned that Sir Richard was married, and hurried to him in much distress.

1090
01:43:41,550 --> 01:43:45,180
We can imagine the grief and horror of the unhappy man.

1091
01:43:45,180 --> 01:43:57,710
In that interview the friend promised to leave all to Sir Richard, to preserve the secret till some means of relief could be found; and with this promise he returned, to guard and comfort the forsaken wife.

1092
01:43:57,710 --> 01:44:08,960
Sir Richard wrote the truth to Lady Trevlyn, meaning to kill himself, as the only way of escape from the terrible situation between two women, both so beloved, both so innocently wronged.

1093
01:44:08,960 --> 01:44:15,190
The pistol lay ready, but death came without its aid, and Sir Richard was spared the sin of suicide."

1094
01:44:15,190 --> 01:44:22,660
Paul paused for breath, but Lady Trevlyn motioned him to go on, still sitting rigid and white as the marble image near her.

1095
01:44:22,660 --> 01:44:25,850
"The friend only lived to reach home and tell the story.

1096
01:44:25,850 --> 01:44:33,460
It killed the wife, and she died, imploring the old priest to see her child righted and its father's name secured to it.

1097
01:44:33,460 --> 01:44:38,200
He promised; but he was poor, the child was a frail baby, and he waited.

1098
01:44:38,200 --> 01:44:48,710
Years passed, and when the child was old enough to ask for its parents and demand its due, the proofs of the marriage were lost, and nothing remained but a ring, a bit of writing, and the name.

1099
01:44:48,710 --> 01:44:57,740
The priest was very old, had neither friends, money, nor proofs to help him; but I was strong and hopeful, and though a mere boy I resolved to do the work.

1100
01:44:57,740 --> 01:45:14,470
I made my way to England, to Trevlyn Hall, and by various stratagems (among which, I am ashamed to say, were false keys and feigned sleepwalking) I collected many proofs, but nothing which would satisfy a court, for no one but you knew where Sir Richard's confession was.

1101
01:45:14,470 --> 01:45:24,870
I searched every nook and corner of the Hall, but in vain, and began to despair, when news of the death of Father Cosmo recalled me to Italy; for Helen was left to my care then.

1102
01:45:24,870 --> 01:45:36,380
The old man had faithfully recorded the facts and left witnesses to prove the truth of his story; but for four years I never used it, never made any effort to secure the title or estates."

1103
01:45:36,380 --> 01:45:38,050
"Why not?"

1104
01:45:38,050 --> 01:45:42,650
breathed my lady in a faint whisper, as hope suddenly revived.

1105
01:45:42,650 --> 01:45:47,620
"Because I was grateful," and for the first time Paul's voice faltered.

1106
01:45:47,620 --> 01:45:50,610
"I was a stranger, and you took me in.

1107
01:45:50,610 --> 01:45:56,170
I never could forget that, nor tie many kindnesses bestowed upon the friendless boy.

1108
01:45:56,170 --> 01:46:02,740
This afflicted me, even while I was acting a false part, and when I was away my heart failed me.

1109
01:46:02,740 --> 01:46:11,850
But Helen gave me no peace; for my sake, she urged me to keep the vow made to that poor mother, and threatened to tell the story herself.

1110
01:46:11,850 --> 01:46:18,890
Talbot's benefaction left me no excuse for delaying longer, and I came to finish the hardest task I can ever undertake.

1111
01:46:18,890 --> 01:46:28,440
I feared that a long dispute would follow any appeal to law, and meant to appeal first to you, but fate befriended me, and the last proof was found."

1112
01:46:28,440 --> 01:46:29,770
"Found!

1113
01:46:29,770 --> 01:46:30,560
Where?"

1114
01:46:30,560 --> 01:46:33,500
cried Lady Trevlyn, springing up aghast.

1115
01:46:33,500 --> 01:46:39,590
"In Sir Richard's coffin, where you hid it, not daring to destroy, yet fearing to keep it."

1116
01:46:39,590 --> 01:46:41,840
"Who has betrayed me?"

1117
01:46:41,840 --> 01:46:47,230
And her eye glanced wildly about the room, as if she feared to see some spectral accuser.

1118
01:46:47,230 --> 01:46:49,090
"Your own lips, my lady.

1119
01:46:49,090 --> 01:46:51,610
Last night I came to speak of this.

1120
01:46:51,610 --> 01:47:00,700
You lay asleep, and in some troubled dream spoke of the paper, safe in its writer's keeping, and your strange treasure here, the key of which you guarded day and night.

1121
01:47:00,700 --> 01:47:02,219
I divined the truth.

1122
01:47:02,219 --> 01:47:11,970
Remembering Hester's stories, I took the key from your helpless hand, found the paper on Sir Richard's dead breast, and now demand that you confess your part in this tragedy."

1123
01:47:11,970 --> 01:47:13,790
"I do, I do!

1124
01:47:13,790 --> 01:47:18,930
I confess, I yield, I relinquish everything, and ask pity only for my child."

1125
01:47:18,930 --> 01:47:31,450
Lady Trevlyn fell upon her knees before him, with a submissive gesture, but imploring eyes, for, amid the wreck of womanly pride and worldly fortune, the mother's heart still clung to its idol.

1126
01:47:31,450 --> 01:47:33,700
"Who should pity her, if not I?

1127
01:47:33,700 --> 01:47:41,560
God knows I would have spared her this blow if I could; but Helen would not keep silent, and I was driven to finish what I had begun.

1128
01:47:41,560 --> 01:47:45,070
Tell Lillian this, and do not let her hate me."

1129
01:47:45,070 --> 01:48:00,690
As Paul spoke, tenderly, eagerly, the curtain parted, and Lillian appeared, trembling with the excitement of that interview, but conscious of only one emotion as she threw herself into his arms, crying in a tone of passionate delight, "Brother!

1130
01:48:00,690 --> 01:48:01,580
Brother!

1131
01:48:01,580 --> 01:48:03,000
Now I may love you!"

1132
01:48:03,000 --> 01:48:07,870
Paul held her close, and for a moment forgot everything but the joy of that moment.

1133
01:48:07,870 --> 01:48:22,560
Lillian spoke first, looking up through tears of tenderness, her little hand laid caressingly against his cheek, as she whispered with sudden bloom in her own, "Now I know why I loved you so well, and now I can see you marry Helen without breaking my heart.

1134
01:48:22,560 --> 01:48:26,620
Oh, Paul, you are still mine, and I care for nothing else."

1135
01:48:26,620 --> 01:48:29,230
"But, Lillian, I am not your brother."

1136
01:48:29,230 --> 01:48:31,750
"Then, in heaven's name, who are you?"

1137
01:48:31,750 --> 01:48:34,760
she cried, tearing herself from his arms.

1138
01:48:34,760 --> 01:48:36,860
"Your lover, dear!"

1139
01:48:36,860 --> 01:48:38,780
"Who, then, is the heir?"

1140
01:48:38,780 --> 01:48:44,570
demanded Lady Trevlyn, springing up, as Lillian turned to seek shelter with her mother.

1141
01:48:44,570 --> 01:48:46,570
"I am."

1142
01:48:46,570 --> 01:48:54,170
Helen spoke, and Helen stood on the threshold of the door, with a hard, haughty look upon her beautiful face.

1143
01:48:54,170 --> 01:48:58,260
"You told your story badly, Paul," she said, in a bitter tone.

1144
01:48:58,260 --> 01:49:07,210
"You forgot me, forgot my affliction, my loneliness, my wrongs, and the natural desire of a child to clear her mother's honor and claim her father's name.

1145
01:49:07,210 --> 01:49:09,750
I am Sir Richard's eldest daughter.

1146
01:49:09,750 --> 01:49:15,590
I can prove my birth, and I demand my right with his own words to sustain me."

1147
01:49:15,590 --> 01:49:24,230
She paused, but no one spoke; and with a slight tremor in her proud voice, she added, "Paul has done the work; he shall have the reward.

1148
01:49:24,230 --> 01:49:26,390
I only want my father's name.

1149
01:49:26,390 --> 01:49:29,500
Title and fortune are nothing to one like me.

1150
01:49:29,500 --> 01:49:36,640
I coveted and claimed them that I might give them to you, Paul, my one friend, always, so tender and so true."

1151
01:49:36,640 --> 01:49:40,320
"I'll have none of it," he answered, almost fiercely.

1152
01:49:40,320 --> 01:49:42,810
"I have kept my promise, and am free.

1153
01:49:42,810 --> 01:49:47,140
You chose to claim your own, although I offered all I had to buy your silence.

1154
01:49:47,140 --> 01:49:50,820
It is yours by rightâ€”take it, and enjoy it if you can.

1155
01:49:50,820 --> 01:49:53,890
I'll have no reward for work like this."

1156
01:49:53,890 --> 01:49:58,860
He turned from her with a look that would have stricken her to the heart could she have seen it.

1157
01:49:58,860 --> 01:50:11,430
She felt it, and it seemed to augment some secret anguish, for she pressed her hands against her bosom with an expression of deep suffering, exclaiming passionately, "Yes, I will keep it, since I am to lose all else.

1158
01:50:11,430 --> 01:50:12,870
I am tired of pity.

1159
01:50:12,870 --> 01:50:15,240
Power is sweet, and I will use it.

1160
01:50:15,240 --> 01:50:22,740
Go, Paul, and be happy if you can, with a nameless wife, and the world's compassion or contempt to sting your pride."

1161
01:50:22,740 --> 01:50:25,230
"Oh, Lillian, where shall we go?

1162
01:50:25,230 --> 01:50:28,450
This is no longer our home, but who will receive us now?"

1163
01:50:28,450 --> 01:50:38,730
cried Lady Trevlyn, in a tone of despair, for her spirit was utterly broken by the thought of the shame and sorrow in store for this beloved and innocent child.

1164
01:50:38,730 --> 01:50:39,830
"I will."

1165
01:50:39,830 --> 01:50:44,350
And Paul's face shone with a love and loyalty they could not doubt.

1166
01:50:44,350 --> 01:50:49,570
"My lady, you gave me a home when I was homeless; now let me pay my debt.

1167
01:50:49,570 --> 01:50:56,590
Lillian, I have loved you from the time when, a romantic boy, I wore your little picture in my breast, and vowed to win you if I lived.

1168
01:50:56,590 --> 01:51:03,660
I dared not speak before, but now, when other hearts may be shut against you, mine stands wide open to welcome you.

1169
01:51:03,660 --> 01:51:04,880
Come, both.

1170
01:51:04,880 --> 01:51:08,870
Let me protect and cherish you, and so atone for the sorrow I have brought you."

1171
01:51:08,870 --> 01:51:20,780
It was impossible to resist the sincere urgency of his voice, the tender reverence of his manner, as he took the two forlorn yet innocent creatures into the shelter of his strength and love.

1172
01:51:20,780 --> 01:51:29,680
They clung to him instinctively, feeling that there still remained to them one staunch friend whom adversity could not estrange.

1173
01:51:29,680 --> 01:51:39,560
An eloquent silence fell upon the room, broken only by sobs, grateful whispers, and the voiceless vows that lovers plight with eyes, and hands, and tender lips.

1174
01:51:39,560 --> 01:51:51,360
Helen was forgotten, till Lillian, whose elastic spirit threw off sorrow as a flower sheds the rain, looked up to thank Paul, with smiles as well as tears, and saw the lonely figure in the shadow.

1175
01:51:51,360 --> 01:52:00,830
Her attitude was full of pathetic significance; she still stood on the threshold, for no one had welcomed her, and in the strange room she knew not where to go;

1176
01:52:00,830 --> 01:52:12,430
her hands were clasped before her face, as if those sightless eyes had seen the joy she could not share, and at her feet lay the time-stained paper that gave her a barren title, but no love.

1177
01:52:12,430 --> 01:52:28,620
Had Lillian known how sharp a conflict between passion and pride, jealousy and generosity, was going on in that young heart, she could not have spoken in a tone of truer pity or sincerer goodwill than that in which she softly said, "Poor girl!

1178
01:52:28,620 --> 01:52:33,740
We must not forget her, for, with all her wealth, she is poor compared to us.

1179
01:52:33,740 --> 01:52:38,560
We both had one father, and should love each other in spite of this misfortune.

1180
01:52:38,560 --> 01:52:41,970
Helen, may I call you sister?"

1181
01:52:41,970 --> 01:52:43,620
"Not yet.

1182
01:52:43,620 --> 01:52:45,660
Wait till I deserve it."

1183
01:52:45,660 --> 01:53:01,470
As if that sweet voice had kindled an answering spark of nobleness in her own heart, Helen's face changed beautifully, as she tore the paper to shreds, saying in a glad, impetuous tone, while the white flakes fluttered from her hands, "I, too, can be generous.

1184
01:53:01,470 --> 01:53:02,870
I, too, can forgive.

1185
01:53:02,870 --> 01:53:04,510
I bury the sad past.

1186
01:53:04,510 --> 01:53:05,200
See!

1187
01:53:05,200 --> 01:53:12,340
I yield my claim, I destroy my proofs, I promise eternal silence, and keep 'Paul's cousin' for my only title.

1188
01:53:12,340 --> 01:53:15,440
Yes, you are happy, for you love one another!"

1189
01:53:15,440 --> 01:53:18,180
she cried, with a sudden passion of tears.

1190
01:53:18,180 --> 01:53:23,640
"Oh, forgive me, pity me, and take me in, for I am all alone and in the dark!"

1191
01:53:23,640 --> 01:53:34,100
There could be but one reply to an appeal like that, and they gave it, as they welcomed her with words that sealed a household league of mutual secrecy and sacrifice.

1192
01:53:34,100 --> 01:53:48,880
They were happy, for the world never knew the hidden tie that bound them so faithfully together, never learned how well the old prophecy had been fulfilled, or guessed what a tragedy of life and death the silver key unlocked.
