The Sign of the Broken Sword

00:00:23,830 --> 00:00:25,040
Part 1

8
00:00:25,040 --> 00:00:32,890
The thousand arms of the forest were grey, and its million fingers silver.

9
00:00:32,890 --> 00:00:42,570
In a sky of dark green-blue-like slate the stars were bleak and brilliant like splintered ice.

10
00:00:42,570 --> 00:00:50,280
All that thickly wooded and sparsely tenanted countryside was stiff with a bitter and brittle frost.

11
00:00:50,280 --> 00:01:02,940
The black hollows between the trunks of the trees looked like bottomless, black caverns of that Scandinavian hell, a hell of incalculable cold.

12
00:01:02,940 --> 00:01:14,680
Even the square stone tower of the church looked northern to the point of heathenry, as if it were some barbaric tower among the sea rocks of Iceland.

13
00:01:14,680 --> 00:01:19,340
It was a queer night for anyone to explore a churchyard.

14
00:01:19,340 --> 00:01:23,100
But, on the other hand, perhaps it was worth exploring.

15
00:01:23,100 --> 00:01:35,830
It rose abruptly out of the ashen wastes of forest in a sort of hump or shoulder of green turf that looked grey in the starlight.

16
00:01:35,830 --> 00:01:43,580
Most of the graves were on a slant, and the path leading up to the church was as steep as a staircase.

17
00:01:43,580 --> 00:01:51,800
On the top of the hill, in the one flat and prominent place, was the monument for which the place was famous.

18
00:01:51,800 --> 00:02:10,220
It contrasted strangely with the featureless graves all round, for it was the work of one of the greatest sculptors of modern Europe; and yet his fame was at once forgotten in the fame of the man whose image he had made.

19
00:02:10,220 --> 00:02:25,550
It showed, by touches of the small silver pencil of starlight, the massive metal figure of a soldier recumbent, the strong hands sealed in an everlasting worship, the great head pillowed upon a gun.

20
00:02:25,550 --> 00:02:32,740
The venerable face was bearded, or rather whiskered, in the old, heavy Colonel Newcome fashion.

21
00:02:32,740 --> 00:02:40,940
The uniform, though suggested with the few strokes of simplicity, was that of modern war.

22
00:02:40,940 --> 00:02:49,120
By his right side lay a sword, of which the tip was broken off; on the left side lay a Bible.

23
00:02:49,120 --> 00:03:07,220
On glowing summer afternoons wagonettes came full of Americans and cultured suburbans to see the sepulchre; but even then they felt the vast forest land with its one dumpy dome of churchyard and church as a place oddly dumb and neglected.

24
00:03:07,220 --> 00:03:13,940
In this freezing darkness of mid-winter one would think he might be left alone with the stars.

25
00:03:13,940 --> 00:03:26,980
Nevertheless, in the stillness of those stiff woods a wooden gate creaked, and two dim figures dressed in black climbed up the little path to the tomb.

26
00:03:28,000 --> 00:03:44,500
So faint was that frigid starlight that nothing could have been traced about them except that while they both wore black, one man was enormously big, and the other (perhaps by contrast) almost startlingly small.

27
00:03:44,500 --> 00:03:52,750
They went up to the great graven tomb of the historic warrior, and stood for a few minutes staring at it.

28
00:03:52,750 --> 00:04:02,720
There was no human, perhaps no living, thing for a wide circle; and a morbid fancy might well have wondered if they were human themselves.

29
00:04:02,720 --> 00:04:08,380
In any case, the beginning of their conversation might have seemed strange.

30
00:04:08,380 --> 00:04:12,460
After the first silence the small man said to the other:

31
00:04:12,460 --> 00:04:15,880
“Where does a wise man hide a pebble?”

32
00:04:15,880 --> 00:04:21,780
And the tall man answered in a low voice: “On the beach.”

33
00:04:21,780 --> 00:04:29,880
The small man nodded, and after a short silence said: “Where does a wise man hide a leaf?”

34
00:04:29,880 --> 00:04:34,920
And the other answered: “In the forest.”

35
00:04:34,920 --> 00:04:48,580
There was another stillness, and then the tall man resumed: “Do you mean that when a wise man has to hide a real diamond he has been known to hide it among sham ones?”

36
00:04:48,580 --> 00:04:55,370
“No, no,” said the little man with a laugh, “we will let bygones be bygones.”

37
00:04:55,370 --> 00:05:06,330
He stamped his cold feet for a second or two, and then said: “I’m not thinking of that at all, but of something else; something rather peculiar.

38
00:05:06,330 --> 00:05:09,720
Just strike a match, will you?”

39
00:05:09,720 --> 00:05:17,250
The big man fumbled in his pocket, and soon a scratch and a flare painted gold the whole flat side of the monument.

40
00:05:17,250 --> 00:05:28,730
On it was cut in black letters the well-known words which so many Americans had reverently read: “Sacred to the Memory of General Sir Arthur St.

41
00:05:28,730 --> 00:05:39,590
Clare, Hero and Martyr, who Always Vanquished his Enemies and Always Spared Them, and Was Tremendously Slain by Them At Last.

42
00:05:39,590 --> 00:05:45,150
May God in Whom he Trusted both Reward and Revenge him.”

43
00:05:45,150 --> 00:05:50,370
The match burnt the big man’s fingers, blackened, and dropped.

44
00:05:50,370 --> 00:05:54,610
He was about to strike another, but his small companion stopped him.

45
00:05:54,610 --> 00:05:59,450
“That’s all right, Flambeau, old man; I saw what I wanted.

46
00:05:59,450 --> 00:06:02,970
Or, rather, I didn’t see what I didn’t want.

47
00:06:02,970 --> 00:06:10,920
And now we must walk a mile and a half along the road to the next inn, and I will try to tell you all about it.

48
00:06:10,920 --> 00:06:17,960
For Heaven knows a man should have a fire and ale when he dares tell such a story.”

49
00:06:19,300 --> 00:06:29,360
They descended the precipitous path, they relatched the rusty gate, and set off at a stamping, ringing walk down the frozen forest road.

50
00:06:29,360 --> 00:06:34,460
They had gone a full quarter of a mile before the smaller man spoke again.

51
00:06:34,460 --> 00:06:39,720
He said: “Yes; the wise man hides a pebble on the beach.

52
00:06:39,720 --> 00:06:43,250
But what does he do if there is no beach?

53
00:06:43,250 --> 00:06:45,800
Do you know anything of that great St.

54
00:06:45,800 --> 00:06:47,040
Clare trouble?”

55
00:06:47,040 --> 00:06:54,850
“I know nothing about English generals, Father Brown,” answered the large man, laughing, “though a little about English policemen.

56
00:06:54,850 --> 00:07:02,410
I only know that you have dragged me a precious long dance to all the shrines of this fellow, whoever he is.

57
00:07:02,410 --> 00:07:05,800
One would think he got buried in six different places.

58
00:07:05,800 --> 00:07:08,420
I’ve seen a memorial to General St.

59
00:07:08,420 --> 00:07:10,440
Clare in Westminster Abbey.

60
00:07:10,440 --> 00:07:14,220
I’ve seen a ramping equestrian statue of General St.

61
00:07:14,220 --> 00:07:15,810
Clare on the Embankment.

62
00:07:15,810 --> 00:07:17,690
I’ve seen a medallion of St.

63
00:07:17,690 --> 00:07:27,700
Clare in the street he was born in, and another in the street he lived in; and now you drag me after dark to his coffin in the village churchyard.

64
00:07:27,700 --> 00:07:36,880
I am beginning to be a bit tired of his magnificent personality, especially as I don’t in the least know who he was.

65
00:07:36,880 --> 00:07:42,170
What are you hunting for in all these crypts and effigies?”

66
00:07:42,170 --> 00:07:47,080
“I am only looking for one word,” said Father Brown.

67
00:07:47,080 --> 00:07:49,430
“A word that isn’t there.”

68
00:07:49,430 --> 00:07:54,630
“Well,” asked Flambeau; “are you going to tell me anything about it?”

69
00:07:54,630 --> 00:07:58,940
“I must divide it into two parts,” remarked the priest.

70
00:07:58,940 --> 00:08:04,500
“First there is what everybody knows; and then there is what I know.

71
00:08:04,500 --> 00:08:07,910
Now, what everybody knows is short and plain enough.

72
00:08:07,910 --> 00:08:11,220
It is also entirely wrong.”

73
00:08:11,220 --> 00:08:16,060
“Right you are,” said the big man called Flambeau cheerfully.

74
00:08:16,060 --> 00:08:18,890
“Let’s begin at the wrong end.

75
00:08:18,890 --> 00:08:22,830
Let’s begin with what everybody knows, which isn’t true.”

76
00:08:22,830 --> 00:08:34,400
“If not wholly untrue, it is at least very inadequate,” continued Brown; “for in point of fact, all that the public knows amounts precisely to this:

77
00:08:34,400 --> 00:08:36,650
The public knows that Arthur St.

78
00:08:36,650 --> 00:08:39,870
Clare was a great and successful English general.

79
00:08:39,870 --> 00:08:54,240
It knows that after splendid yet careful campaigns both in India and Africa he was in command against Brazil when the great Brazilian patriot Olivier issued his ultimatum.

80
00:08:54,240 --> 00:08:57,090
It knows that on that occasion St.

81
00:08:57,090 --> 00:09:04,860
Clare with a very small force attacked Olivier with a very large one, and was captured after heroic resistance.

82
00:09:04,860 --> 00:09:11,360
And it knows that after his capture, and to the abhorrence of the civilised world, St.

83
00:09:11,360 --> 00:09:13,850
Clare was hanged on the nearest tree.

84
00:09:13,850 --> 00:09:22,090
He was found swinging there after the Brazilians had retired, with his broken sword hung round his neck.”

85
00:09:22,090 --> 00:09:25,590
“And that popular story is untrue?”

86
00:09:25,590 --> 00:09:27,370
suggested Flambeau.

87
00:09:27,370 --> 00:09:34,220
“No,” said his friend quietly, “that story is quite true, so far as it goes.”

88
00:09:34,220 --> 00:09:37,330
“Well, I think it goes far enough!”

89
00:09:37,330 --> 00:09:42,870
said Flambeau; “but if the popular story is true, what is the mystery?”

90
00:09:42,870 --> 00:09:49,940
They had passed many hundreds of grey and ghostly trees before the little priest answered.

91
00:09:49,940 --> 00:09:56,240
Then he bit his finger reflectively and said: “Why, the mystery is a mystery of psychology.

92
00:09:56,240 --> 00:10:00,570
Or, rather, it is a mystery of two psychologies.

93
00:10:00,570 --> 00:10:09,440
In that Brazilian business two of the most famous men of modern history acted flat against their characters.

94
00:10:09,440 --> 00:10:11,040
Mind you, Olivier and St.

95
00:10:11,040 --> 00:10:18,020
Clare were both heroes—the old thing, and no mistake; it was like the fight between Hector and Achilles.

96
00:10:18,020 --> 00:10:25,640
Now, what would you say to an affair in which Achilles was timid and Hector was treacherous?”

97
00:10:25,640 --> 00:10:31,450
“Go on,” said the large man impatiently as the other bit his finger again.

98
00:10:31,450 --> 00:10:33,460
“Sir Arthur St.

99
00:10:33,460 --> 00:10:41,100
Clare was a soldier of the old religious type—the type that saved us during the Mutiny,” continued Brown.

100
00:10:41,100 --> 00:10:53,840
“He was always more for duty than for dash; and with all his personal courage was decidedly a prudent commander, particularly indignant at any needless waste of soldiers.

101
00:10:53,840 --> 00:11:00,900
Yet in this last battle he attempted something that a baby could see was absurd.

102
00:11:00,900 --> 00:11:11,080
One need not be a strategist to see it was as wild as wind; just as one need not be a strategist to keep out of the way of a motor-bus.

103
00:11:11,080 --> 00:11:17,460
Well, that is the first mystery; what had become of the English general’s head?

104
00:11:17,460 --> 00:11:22,880
The second riddle is, what had become of the Brazilian general’s heart?

105
00:11:22,880 --> 00:11:33,500
President Olivier might be called a visionary or a nuisance; but even his enemies admitted that he was magnanimous to the point of knight errantry.

106
00:11:33,500 --> 00:11:40,580
Almost every other prisoner he had ever captured had been set free or even loaded with benefits.

107
00:11:40,580 --> 00:11:46,490
Men who had really wronged him came away touched by his simplicity and sweetness.

108
00:11:46,490 --> 00:11:56,940
Why the deuce should he diabolically revenge himself only once in his life; and that for the one particular blow that could not have hurt him?

109
00:11:56,940 --> 00:11:58,800
Well, there you have it.

110
00:11:58,800 --> 00:12:04,150
One of the wisest men in the world acted like an idiot for no reason.

111
00:12:04,150 --> 00:12:08,890
One of the best men in the world acted like a fiend for no reason.

112
00:12:08,890 --> 00:12:13,750
That’s the long and the short of it; and I leave it to you, my boy.”

113
00:12:13,750 --> 00:12:18,170
“No, you don’t,” said the other with a snort.

114
00:12:18,170 --> 00:12:23,220
“I leave it to you; and you jolly well tell me all about it.”

115
00:12:24,300 --> 00:12:35,090
“Well,” resumed Father Brown, “it’s not fair to say that the public impression is just what I’ve said, without adding that two things have happened since.

116
00:12:35,090 --> 00:12:40,280
I can’t say they threw a new light; for nobody can make sense of them.

117
00:12:40,280 --> 00:12:47,130
But they threw a new kind of darkness; they threw the darkness in new directions.

118
00:12:47,130 --> 00:12:49,250
The first was this.

119
00:12:49,250 --> 00:12:51,600
The family physician of the St.

120
00:12:51,600 --> 00:13:07,180
Clares quarrelled with that family, and began publishing a violent series of articles, in which he said that the late general was a religious maniac; but as far as the tale went, this seemed to mean little more than a religious man.

121
00:13:07,180 --> 00:13:09,750
“Anyhow, the story fizzled out.

122
00:13:09,750 --> 00:13:11,850
Everyone knew, of course, that St.

123
00:13:11,850 --> 00:13:16,030
Clare had some of the eccentricities of puritan piety.

124
00:13:16,030 --> 00:13:20,020
The second incident was much more arresting.

125
00:13:20,020 --> 00:13:31,040
In the luckless and unsupported regiment which made that rash attempt at the Black River there was a certain Captain Keith, who was at that time engaged to St.

126
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,980
Clare’s daughter, and who afterwards married her.

127
00:13:36,100 --> 00:13:45,820
He was one of those who were captured by Olivier, and, like all the rest except the general, appears to have been bounteously treated and promptly set free.

128
00:13:45,820 --> 00:13:57,430
Some twenty years afterwards this man, then Lieutenant-Colonel Keith, published a sort of autobiography called ‘A British Officer in Burma and Brazil.’

129
00:13:57,430 --> 00:14:02,530
In the place where the reader looks eagerly for some account of the mystery of St.

130
00:14:02,530 --> 00:14:07,290
Clare’s disaster may be found the following words:

131
00:14:07,290 --> 00:14:21,270
‘Everywhere else in this book I have narrated things exactly as they occurred, holding as I do the old-fashioned opinion that the glory of England is old enough to take care of itself.

132
00:14:21,270 --> 00:14:32,070
The exception I shall make is in this matter of the defeat by the Black River; and my reasons, though private, are honourable and compelling.

133
00:14:32,070 --> 00:14:38,330
I will, however, add this in justice to the memories of two distinguished men.

134
00:14:38,330 --> 00:14:39,940
General St.

135
00:14:39,940 --> 00:14:52,590
Clare has been accused of incapacity on this occasion; I can at least testify that this action, properly understood, was one of the most brilliant and sagacious of his life.

136
00:14:52,590 --> 00:14:58,430
President Olivier by similar report is charged with savage injustice.

137
00:14:58,430 --> 00:15:07,750
I think it due to the honour of an enemy to say that he acted on this occasion with even more than his characteristic good feeling.

138
00:15:07,750 --> 00:15:12,130
To put the matter popularly, I can assure my countrymen that St.

139
00:15:12,130 --> 00:15:18,790
Clare was by no means such a fool nor Olivier such a brute as he looked.

140
00:15:18,790 --> 00:15:28,040
This is all I have to say; nor shall any earthly consideration induce me to add a word to it.’”

141
00:15:28,040 --> 00:15:44,250
A large frozen moon like a lustrous snowball began to show through the tangle of twigs in front of them, and by its light the narrator had been able to refresh his memory of Captain Keith’s text from a scrap of printed paper.

142
00:15:44,250 --> 00:15:51,250
As he folded it up and put it back in his pocket Flambeau threw up his hand with a French gesture.

143
00:15:51,250 --> 00:15:55,410
“Wait a bit, wait a bit,” he cried excitedly.

144
00:15:55,410 --> 00:15:58,990
“I believe I can guess it at the first go.”

145
00:15:58,990 --> 00:16:07,350
He strode on, breathing hard, his black head and bull neck forward, like a man winning a walking race.

146
00:16:07,350 --> 00:16:12,940
The little priest, amused and interested, had some trouble in trotting beside him.

147
00:16:12,940 --> 00:16:25,500
Just before them the trees fell back a little to left and right, and the road swept downwards across a clear, moonlit valley, till it dived again like a rabbit into the wall of another wood.

148
00:16:25,500 --> 00:16:33,230
The entrance to the farther forest looked small and round, like the black hole of a remote railway tunnel.

149
00:16:33,230 --> 00:16:40,330
But it was within some hundred yards, and gaped like a cavern before Flambeau spoke again.

150
00:16:40,330 --> 00:16:46,300
“I’ve got it,” he cried at last, slapping his thigh with his great hand.

151
00:16:46,300 --> 00:16:50,940
“Four minutes’ thinking, and I can tell your whole story myself.”

152
00:16:50,940 --> 00:16:53,240
“All right,” assented his friend.

153
00:16:53,240 --> 00:16:54,740
“You tell it.”

154
00:16:54,740 --> 00:16:58,900
Flambeau lifted his head, but lowered his voice.

155
00:16:58,900 --> 00:17:01,850
“General Sir Arthur St.

156
00:17:01,850 --> 00:17:14,290
Clare,” he said, “came of a family in which madness was hereditary; and his whole aim was to keep this from his daughter, and even, if possible, from his future son-in-law.

157
00:17:14,290 --> 00:17:20,290
Rightly or wrongly, he thought the final collapse was close, and resolved on suicide.

158
00:17:20,290 --> 00:17:25,610
Yet ordinary suicide would blazon the very idea he dreaded.

159
00:17:25,610 --> 00:17:37,140
As the campaign approached the clouds came thicker on his brain; and at last in a mad moment he sacrificed his public duty to his private.

160
00:17:37,140 --> 00:17:41,860
He rushed rashly into battle, hoping to fall by the first shot.

161
00:17:41,860 --> 00:17:51,750
When he found that he had only attained capture and discredit, the sealed bomb in his brain burst, and he broke his own sword and hanged himself.”

162
00:17:51,750 --> 00:18:02,690
He stared firmly at the grey facade of forest in front of him, with the one black gap in it, like the mouth of the grave, into which their path plunged.

163
00:18:02,690 --> 00:18:12,220
Perhaps something menacing in the road thus suddenly swallowed reinforced his vivid vision of the tragedy, for he shuddered.

164
00:18:12,220 --> 00:18:15,070
“A horrid story,” he said.

165
00:18:15,070 --> 00:18:18,850
“A horrid story,” repeated the priest with bent head.

166
00:18:18,850 --> 00:18:21,750
“But not the real story.”

167
00:18:21,750 --> 00:18:29,850
Then he threw back his head with a sort of despair and cried: “Oh, I wish it had been.”

168
00:18:29,850 --> 00:18:33,700
The tall Flambeau faced round and stared at him.

169
00:18:33,700 --> 00:18:38,490
“Yours is a clean story,” cried Father Brown, deeply moved.

170
00:18:38,490 --> 00:18:44,500
“A sweet, pure, honest story, as open and white as that moon.

171
00:18:44,500 --> 00:18:47,500
Madness and despair are innocent enough.

172
00:18:47,500 --> 00:18:51,080
There are worse things, Flambeau.”

173
00:18:52,080 --> 00:19:02,410
Flambeau looked up wildly at the moon thus invoked; and from where he stood one black tree-bough curved across it exactly like a devil’s horn.

174
00:19:02,410 --> 00:19:12,920
“Father—father,” cried Flambeau with the French gesture and stepping yet more rapidly forward, “do you mean it was worse than that?”

175
00:19:12,920 --> 00:19:17,370
“Worse than that,” said Paul like a grave echo.

176
00:19:17,370 --> 00:19:28,830
And they plunged into the black cloister of the woodland, which ran by them in a dim tapestry of trunks, like one of the dark corridors in a dream.

177
00:19:28,830 --> 00:19:38,720
They were soon in the most secret entrails of the wood, and felt close about them foliage that they could not see, when the priest said again:

178
00:19:38,720 --> 00:19:42,450
“Where does a wise man hide a leaf?

179
00:19:42,450 --> 00:19:43,730
In the forest.

180
00:19:43,730 --> 00:19:47,700
But what does he do if there is no forest?”

181
00:19:47,700 --> 00:19:52,230
“Well, well,” cried Flambeau irritably, “what does he do?”

182
00:19:52,230 --> 00:19:58,290
“He grows a forest to hide it in,” said the priest in an obscure voice.

183
00:19:58,290 --> 00:20:00,770
“A fearful sin.”

184
00:20:00,770 --> 00:20:11,300
“Look here,” cried his friend impatiently, for the dark wood and the dark saying got a little on his nerves; “will you tell me this story or not?

185
00:20:11,300 --> 00:20:14,020
What other evidence is there to go on?”

186
00:20:14,020 --> 00:20:24,950
“There are three more bits of evidence,” said the other, “that I have dug up in holes and corners; and I will give them in logical rather than chronological order.

187
00:20:24,950 --> 00:20:34,080
First of all, of course, our authority for the issue and event of the battle is in Olivier’s own dispatches, which are lucid enough.

188
00:20:34,080 --> 00:20:44,300
He was entrenched with two or three regiments on the heights that swept down to the Black River, on the other side of which was lower and more marshy ground.

189
00:20:44,300 --> 00:20:55,540
Beyond this again was gently rising country, on which was the first English outpost, supported by others which lay, however, considerably in its rear.

190
00:20:55,540 --> 00:21:09,290
The British forces as a whole were greatly superior in numbers; but this particular regiment was just far enough from its base to make Olivier consider the project of crossing the river to cut it off.

191
00:21:09,290 --> 00:21:16,600
By sunset, however, he had decided to retain his own position, which was a specially strong one.

192
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:32,560
At daybreak next morning he was thunderstruck to see that this stray handful of English, entirely unsupported from their rear, had flung themselves across the river, half by a bridge to the right, and the other half by a ford higher up,

193
00:21:32,560 --> 00:21:35,510
and were massed upon the marshy bank below him.

194
00:21:35,510 --> 00:21:46,680
“That they should attempt an attack with such numbers against such a position was incredible enough; but Olivier noticed something yet more extraordinary.

195
00:21:46,680 --> 00:22:01,130
For instead of attempting to seize more solid ground, this mad regiment, having put the river in its rear by one wild charge, did nothing more, but stuck there in the mire like flies in treacle.

196
00:22:01,130 --> 00:22:10,550
Needless to say, the Brazilians blew great gaps in them with artillery, which they could only return with spirited but lessening rifle fire.

197
00:22:10,550 --> 00:22:20,070
Yet they never broke; and Olivier’s curt account ends with a strong tribute of admiration for the mystic valour of these imbeciles.

198
00:22:20,070 --> 00:22:27,620
‘Our line then advanced finally,’ writes Olivier, ‘and drove them into the river; we captured General St.

199
00:22:27,620 --> 00:22:30,250
Clare himself and several other officers.

200
00:22:30,250 --> 00:22:33,560
The colonel and the major had both fallen in the battle.

201
00:22:33,560 --> 00:22:51,960
I cannot resist saying that few finer sights can have been seen in history than the last stand of this extraordinary regiment; wounded officers picking up the rifles of dead soldiers, and the general himself facing us on horseback bareheaded and with a broken sword.’

202
00:22:51,960 --> 00:22:57,690
On what happened to the general afterwards Olivier is as silent as Captain Keith.”

203
00:22:57,690 --> 00:23:03,600
“Well,” grunted Flambeau, “get on to the next bit of evidence.”

The Sign of the Broken Sword

This LibriVox recording is in the public domain.

00:23:20,000 --> 00:23:22,280
Part 2

208
00:23:22,280 --> 00:23:30,790
“The next evidence,” said Father Brown, “took some time to find, but it will not take long to tell.

209
00:23:30,790 --> 00:23:44,850
I found at last in an almshouse down in the Lincolnshire Fens an old soldier who not only was wounded at the Black River, but had actually knelt beside the colonel of the regiment when he died.

210
00:23:44,850 --> 00:23:56,010
This latter was a certain Colonel Clancy, a big bull of an Irishman; and it would seem that he died almost as much of rage as of bullets.

211
00:23:56,010 --> 00:24:04,500
He, at any rate, was not responsible for that ridiculous raid; it must have been imposed on him by the general.

212
00:24:04,500 --> 00:24:14,090
His last edifying words, according to my informant, were these: ‘And there goes the damned old donkey with the end of his sword knocked off.

213
00:24:14,090 --> 00:24:16,250
I wish it was his head.’

214
00:24:16,250 --> 00:24:27,420
You will remark that everyone seems to have noticed this detail about the broken sword blade, though most people regard it somewhat more reverently than did the late Colonel Clancy.

215
00:24:27,420 --> 00:24:30,400
And now for the third fragment.”

216
00:24:30,400 --> 00:24:37,930
Their path through the woodland began to go upward, and the speaker paused a little for breath before he went on.

217
00:24:37,930 --> 00:24:41,730
Then he continued in the same business-like tone:

218
00:24:41,730 --> 00:24:50,840
“Only a month or two ago a certain Brazilian official died in England, having quarrelled with Olivier and left his country.

219
00:24:50,840 --> 00:25:03,350
He was a well-known figure both here and on the Continent, a Spaniard named Espado; I knew him myself, a yellow-faced old dandy, with a hooked nose.

220
00:25:03,350 --> 00:25:12,840
For various private reasons I had permission to see the documents he had left; he was a Catholic, of course, and I had been with him towards the end.

221
00:25:12,840 --> 00:25:16,500
There was nothing of his that lit up any corner of the black St.

222
00:25:16,500 --> 00:25:24,200
Clare business, except five or six common exercise books filled with the diary of some English soldier.

223
00:25:24,200 --> 00:25:29,640
I can only suppose that it was found by the Brazilians on one of those that fell.

224
00:25:29,640 --> 00:25:33,040
Anyhow, it stopped abruptly the night before the battle.

225
00:25:33,040 --> 00:25:40,800
“But the account of that last day in the poor fellow’s life was certainly worth reading.

226
00:25:40,800 --> 00:25:46,190
I have it on me; but it’s too dark to read it here, and I will give you a resume.

227
00:25:46,190 --> 00:25:54,810
The first part of that entry is full of jokes, evidently flung about among the men, about somebody called the Vulture.

228
00:25:54,810 --> 00:26:05,380
It does not seem as if this person, whoever he was, was one of themselves, nor even an Englishman; neither is he exactly spoken of as one of the enemy.

229
00:26:05,380 --> 00:26:13,500
It sounds rather as if he were some local go-between and non-combatant; perhaps a guide or a journalist.

230
00:26:13,500 --> 00:26:20,130
He has been closeted with old Colonel Clancy; but is more often seen talking to the major.

231
00:26:20,130 --> 00:26:31,050
Indeed, the major is somewhat prominent in this soldier’s narrative; a lean, dark-haired man, apparently, of the name of Murray—a north of Ireland man and a Puritan.

232
00:26:31,050 --> 00:26:39,630
There are continual jests about the contrast between this Ulsterman’s austerity and the conviviality of Colonel Clancy.

233
00:26:39,630 --> 00:26:44,600
There is also some joke about the Vulture wearing bright-coloured clothes.

234
00:26:44,600 --> 00:26:51,790
“But all these levities are scattered by what may well be called the note of a bugle.

235
00:26:51,790 --> 00:26:59,420
Behind the English camp and almost parallel to the river ran one of the few great roads of that district.

236
00:26:59,420 --> 00:27:05,450
Westward the road curved round towards the river, which it crossed by the bridge before mentioned.

237
00:27:05,450 --> 00:27:13,520
To the east the road swept backwards into the wilds, and some two miles along it was the next English outpost.

238
00:27:13,520 --> 00:27:26,540
From this direction there came along the road that evening a glitter and clatter of light cavalry, in which even the simple diarist could recognise with astonishment the general with his staff.

239
00:27:26,540 --> 00:27:38,580
He rode the great white horse which you have seen so often in illustrated papers and Academy pictures; and you may be sure that the salute they gave him was not merely ceremonial.

240
00:27:38,580 --> 00:27:50,110
He, at least, wasted no time on ceremony, but, springing from the saddle immediately, mixed with the group of officers, and fell into emphatic though confidential speech.

241
00:27:50,110 --> 00:28:02,740
What struck our friend the diarist most was his special disposition to discuss matters with Major Murray; but, indeed, such a selection, so long as it was not marked, was in no way unnatural.

242
00:28:02,740 --> 00:28:12,270
The two men were made for sympathy; they were men who ‘read their Bibles’; they were both the old Evangelical type of officer.

243
00:28:12,270 --> 00:28:29,280
However this may be, it is certain that when the general mounted again he was still talking earnestly to Murray; and that as he walked his horse slowly down the road towards the river, the tall Ulsterman still walked by his bridle rein in earnest debate.

244
00:28:29,280 --> 00:28:36,640
The soldiers watched the two until they vanished behind a clump of trees where the road turned towards the river.

245
00:28:36,640 --> 00:28:47,140
The colonel had gone back to his tent, and the men to their pickets; the man with the diary lingered for another four minutes, and saw a marvellous sight.

246
00:28:47,140 --> 00:29:00,230
“The great white horse which had marched slowly down the road, as it had marched in so many processions, flew back, galloping up the road towards them as if it were mad to win a race.

247
00:29:00,230 --> 00:29:09,810
At first they thought it had run away with the man on its back; but they soon saw that the general, a fine rider, was himself urging it to full speed.

248
00:29:09,810 --> 00:29:23,020
Horse and man swept up to them like a whirlwind; and then, reining up the reeling charger, the general turned on them a face like flame, and called for the colonel like the trumpet that wakes the dead.

249
00:29:23,020 --> 00:29:33,090
“I conceive that all the earthquake events of that catastrophe tumbled on top of each other rather like lumber in the minds of men such as our friend with the diary.

250
00:29:33,090 --> 00:29:44,500
With the dazed excitement of a dream, they found themselves falling—literally falling—into their ranks, and learned that an attack was to be led at once across the river.

251
00:29:44,500 --> 00:29:53,130
The general and the major, it was said, had found out something at the bridge, and there was only just time to strike for life.

252
00:29:53,130 --> 00:30:02,510
The major had gone back at once to call up the reserve along the road behind; it was doubtful if even with that prompt appeal help could reach them in time.

253
00:30:02,510 --> 00:30:08,310
But they must pass the stream that night, and seize the heights by morning.

254
00:30:08,310 --> 00:30:17,080
It is with the very stir and throb of that romantic nocturnal march that the diary suddenly ends.”

255
00:30:17,080 --> 00:30:28,270
Father Brown had mounted ahead; for the woodland path grew smaller, steeper, and more twisted, till they felt as if they were ascending a winding staircase.

256
00:30:28,270 --> 00:30:32,530
The priest’s voice came from above out of the darkness.

257
00:30:32,530 --> 00:30:36,300
“There was one other little and enormous thing.

258
00:30:36,300 --> 00:30:47,750
When the general urged them to their chivalric charge he half drew his sword from the scabbard; and then, as if ashamed of such melodrama, thrust it back again.

259
00:30:47,750 --> 00:30:50,060
The sword again, you see.”

260
00:30:50,060 --> 00:31:01,650
A half-light broke through the network of boughs above them, flinging the ghost of a net about their feet; for they were mounting again to the faint luminosity of the naked night.

261
00:31:01,650 --> 00:31:08,750
Flambeau felt truth all round him as an atmosphere, but not as an idea.

262
00:31:08,750 --> 00:31:14,090
He answered with bewildered brain: “Well, what’s the matter with the sword?

263
00:31:14,090 --> 00:31:17,340
Officers generally have swords, don’t they?”

264
00:31:17,340 --> 00:31:28,760
“They are not often mentioned in modern war,” said the other dispassionately; “but in this affair one falls over the blessed sword everywhere.”

265
00:31:28,760 --> 00:31:31,480
“Well, what is there in that?”

266
00:31:31,480 --> 00:31:38,950
growled Flambeau; “it was a twopence coloured sort of incident; the old man’s blade breaking in his last battle.

267
00:31:38,950 --> 00:31:42,750
Anyone might bet the papers would get hold of it, as they have.

268
00:31:42,750 --> 00:31:46,860
On all these tombs and things it’s shown broken at the point.

269
00:31:46,860 --> 00:31:54,820
I hope you haven’t dragged me through this Polar expedition merely because two men with an eye for a picture saw St.

270
00:31:54,820 --> 00:31:56,630
Clare’s broken sword.”

271
00:31:56,630 --> 00:32:04,630
“No,” cried Father Brown, with a sharp voice like a pistol shot; “but who saw his unbroken sword?”

272
00:32:04,630 --> 00:32:06,250
“What do you mean?”

273
00:32:06,250 --> 00:32:09,500
cried the other, and stood still under the stars.

274
00:32:09,500 --> 00:32:13,660
They had come abruptly out of the grey gates of the wood.

275
00:32:13,660 --> 00:32:18,110
“I say, who saw his unbroken sword?”

276
00:32:18,110 --> 00:32:20,370
repeated Father Brown obstinately.

277
00:32:20,370 --> 00:32:25,290
“Not the writer of the diary, anyhow; the general sheathed it in time.”

278
00:32:25,290 --> 00:32:35,180
Flambeau looked about him in the moonlight, as a man struck blind might look in the sun; and his friend went on, for the first time with eagerness:

279
00:32:35,180 --> 00:32:41,710
“Flambeau,” he cried, “I cannot prove it, even after hunting through the tombs.

280
00:32:41,710 --> 00:32:43,820
But I am sure of it.

281
00:32:43,820 --> 00:32:49,180
Let me add just one more tiny fact that tips the whole thing over.

282
00:32:49,180 --> 00:32:54,840
The colonel, by a strange chance, was one of the first struck by a bullet.

283
00:32:54,840 --> 00:32:58,700
He was struck long before the troops came to close quarters.

284
00:32:58,700 --> 00:33:00,100
But he saw St.

285
00:33:00,100 --> 00:33:02,090
Clare’s sword broken.

286
00:33:02,090 --> 00:33:03,890
Why was it broken?

287
00:33:03,890 --> 00:33:05,470
How was it broken?

288
00:33:05,470 --> 00:33:11,980
My friend, it was broken before the battle.”

289
00:33:11,980 --> 00:33:12,430
“Oh!”

290
00:33:12,430 --> 00:33:19,250
said his friend, with a sort of forlorn jocularity; “and pray where is the other piece?”

291
00:33:19,250 --> 00:33:22,580
“I can tell you,” said the priest promptly.

292
00:33:22,580 --> 00:33:27,760
“In the northeast corner of the cemetery of the Protestant Cathedral at Belfast.”

293
00:33:27,760 --> 00:33:28,690
“Indeed?”

294
00:33:28,690 --> 00:33:30,220
inquired the other.

295
00:33:30,220 --> 00:33:31,570
“Have you looked for it?”

296
00:33:31,570 --> 00:33:34,840
“I couldn’t,” replied Brown, with frank regret.

297
00:33:34,840 --> 00:33:45,610
“There’s a great marble monument on top of it; a monument to the heroic Major Murray, who fell fighting gloriously at the famous Battle of the Black River.”

298
00:33:45,610 --> 00:33:49,920
Flambeau seemed suddenly galvanised into existence.

299
00:33:49,920 --> 00:33:54,320
“You mean,” he cried hoarsely, “that General St.

300
00:33:54,320 --> 00:33:58,930
Clare hated Murray, and murdered him on the field of battle because—”

301
00:33:58,930 --> 00:34:02,770
“You are still full of good and pure thoughts,” said the other.

302
00:34:02,770 --> 00:34:05,400
“It was worse than that.”

303
00:34:05,400 --> 00:34:11,930
“Well,” said the large man, “my stock of evil imagination is used up.”

304
00:34:11,930 --> 00:34:17,840
The priest seemed really doubtful where to begin, and at last he said again:

305
00:34:17,840 --> 00:34:21,590
“Where would a wise man hide a leaf?

306
00:34:21,590 --> 00:34:23,220
In the forest.”

307
00:34:23,220 --> 00:34:25,120
The other did not answer.

308
00:34:25,120 --> 00:34:29,550
“If there were no forest, he would make a forest.

309
00:34:29,550 --> 00:34:34,580
And if he wished to hide a dead leaf, he would make a dead forest.”

310
00:34:34,580 --> 00:34:40,390
There was still no reply, and the priest added still more mildly and quietly:

311
00:34:40,390 --> 00:34:46,330
“And if a man had to hide a dead body, he would make a field of dead bodies to hide it in.”

312
00:34:46,330 --> 00:34:57,310
Flambeau began to stamp forward with an intolerance of delay in time or space; but Father Brown went on as if he were continuing the last sentence:

313
00:34:57,310 --> 00:34:59,250
“Sir Arthur St.

314
00:34:59,250 --> 00:35:03,490
Clare, as I have already said, was a man who read his Bible.

315
00:35:03,490 --> 00:35:06,260
That was what was the matter with him.

316
00:35:06,260 --> 00:35:15,380
When will people understand that it is useless for a man to read his Bible unless he also reads everybody else’s Bible?

317
00:35:15,380 --> 00:35:18,250
A printer reads a Bible for misprints.

318
00:35:18,250 --> 00:35:27,520
A Mormon reads his Bible to find polygamy; a Christian Scientist reads his, and finds we have no arms and legs.

319
00:35:27,520 --> 00:35:28,390
St.

320
00:35:28,390 --> 00:35:32,040
Clare was an old Anglo-Indian Protestant soldier.

321
00:35:32,040 --> 00:35:38,230
Now, just think what that might mean; and, for Heaven’s sake, don’t cant about it.

322
00:35:38,230 --> 00:35:50,120
It might mean a man physically formidable living under a tropic sun in an Oriental society, and soaking himself without sense or guidance in an Oriental Book.

323
00:35:50,120 --> 00:35:53,250
Of course, he read the Old Testament rather than the New.

324
00:35:53,250 --> 00:36:00,160
Of course, he found in the Old Testament anything that he wanted—lust, tyranny, treason.

325
00:36:00,160 --> 00:36:03,950
Oh, I dare say he was honest, as you call it.

326
00:36:03,950 --> 00:36:09,960
But what is the good of a man being honest in his worship of dishonesty?

327
00:36:09,960 --> 00:36:27,330
“In each of the hot and secret countries to which the man went he kept a harem, he tortured witnesses, he amassed shameful gold; but certainly he would have said with steady eyes that he did it to the glory of the Lord.

328
00:36:27,330 --> 00:36:32,460
My own theology is sufficiently expressed by asking which Lord?

329
00:36:32,460 --> 00:36:43,050
Anyhow, there is this about such evil, that it opens door after door in hell, and always into smaller and smaller chambers.

330
00:36:43,050 --> 00:36:52,320
This is the real case against crime, that a man does not become wilder and wilder, but only meaner and meaner.

331
00:36:52,320 --> 00:36:53,200
St.

332
00:36:53,200 --> 00:37:00,280
Clare was soon suffocated by difficulties of bribery and blackmail; and needed more and more cash.

333
00:37:00,280 --> 00:37:10,440
And by the time of the Battle of the Black River he had fallen from world to world to that place which Dante makes the lowest floor of the universe.”

334
00:37:10,440 --> 00:37:11,760
“What do you mean?”

335
00:37:11,760 --> 00:37:13,460
asked his friend again.

336
00:37:13,460 --> 00:37:20,520
“I mean that,” retorted the cleric, and suddenly pointed at a puddle sealed with ice that shone in the moon.

337
00:37:20,520 --> 00:37:25,170
“Do you remember whom Dante put in the last circle of ice?”

338
00:37:25,170 --> 00:37:29,690
“The traitors,” said Flambeau, and shuddered.

339
00:37:29,690 --> 00:37:47,820
As he looked around at the inhuman landscape of trees, with taunting and almost obscene outlines, he could almost fancy he was Dante, and the priest with the rivulet of a voice was, indeed, a Virgil leading him through a land of eternal sins.

340
00:37:47,820 --> 00:37:57,110
The voice went on: “Olivier, as you know, was quixotic, and would not permit a secret service and spies.

341
00:37:57,110 --> 00:38:01,830
The thing, however, was done, like many other things, behind his back.

342
00:38:01,830 --> 00:38:10,680
It was managed by my old friend Espado; he was the bright-clad fop, whose hook nose got him called the Vulture.

343
00:38:10,680 --> 00:38:24,590
Posing as a sort of philanthropist at the front, he felt his way through the English Army, and at last got his fingers on its one corrupt man—please God!—and that man at the top.

344
00:38:24,590 --> 00:38:25,080
St.

345
00:38:25,080 --> 00:38:29,140
Clare was in foul need of money, and mountains of it.

346
00:38:29,140 --> 00:38:47,670
The discredited family doctor was threatening those extraordinary exposures that afterwards began and were broken off; tales of monstrous and prehistoric things in Park Lane; things done by an English Evangelist that smelt like human sacrifice and hordes of slaves.

347
00:38:47,670 --> 00:38:55,720
Money was wanted, too, for his daughter’s dowry; for to him the fame of wealth was as sweet as wealth itself.

348
00:38:55,720 --> 00:39:04,130
He snapped the last thread, whispered the word to Brazil, and wealth poured in from the enemies of England.

349
00:39:04,130 --> 00:39:08,510
But another man had talked to Espado the Vulture as well as he.

350
00:39:08,510 --> 00:39:26,630
Somehow the dark, grim young major from Ulster had guessed the hideous truth; and when they walked slowly together down that road towards the bridge Murray was telling the general that he must resign instantly, or be court-martialled and shot.

351
00:39:26,630 --> 00:39:43,520
The general temporised with him till they came to the fringe of tropic trees by the bridge; and there by the singing river and the sunlit palms (for I can see the picture) the general drew his sabre and plunged it through the body of the major.”

352
00:39:43,520 --> 00:40:02,500
The wintry road curved over a ridge in cutting frost, with cruel black shapes of bush and thicket; but Flambeau fancied that he saw beyond it faintly the edge of an aureole that was not starlight and moonlight, but some fire such as is made by men.

353
00:40:02,500 --> 00:40:06,580
He watched it as the tale drew to its close.

354
00:40:06,580 --> 00:40:07,900
“St.

355
00:40:07,900 --> 00:40:12,660
Clare was a hell-hound, but he was a hound of breed.

356
00:40:12,660 --> 00:40:21,130
Never, I’ll swear, was he so lucid and so strong as when poor Murray lay a cold lump at his feet.

357
00:40:21,130 --> 00:40:32,560
Never in all his triumphs, as Captain Keith said truly, was the great man so great as he was in this last world-despised defeat.

358
00:40:32,560 --> 00:40:41,480
He looked coolly at his weapon to wipe off the blood; he saw the point he had planted between his victim’s shoulders had broken off in the body.

359
00:40:41,480 --> 00:40:47,970
He saw quite calmly, as through a club windowpane, all that must follow.

360
00:40:47,970 --> 00:40:59,800
He saw that men must find the unaccountable corpse; must extract the unaccountable sword-point; must notice the unaccountable broken sword—or absence of sword.

361
00:40:59,800 --> 00:41:03,120
He had killed, but not silenced.

362
00:41:03,120 --> 00:41:09,510
But his imperious intellect rose against the facer; there was one way yet.

363
00:41:09,510 --> 00:41:12,980
He could make the corpse less unaccountable.

364
00:41:12,980 --> 00:41:17,500
He could create a hill of corpses to cover this one.

365
00:41:17,500 --> 00:41:24,460
In twenty minutes eight hundred English soldiers were marching down to their death.”

366
00:41:25,700 --> 00:41:33,120
The warmer glow behind the black winter wood grew richer and brighter, and Flambeau strode on to reach it.

367
00:41:33,120 --> 00:41:39,390
Father Brown also quickened his stride; but he seemed merely absorbed in his tale.

368
00:41:39,390 --> 00:41:51,910
“Such was the valour of that English thousand, and such the genius of their commander, that if they had at once attacked the hill, even their mad march might have met some luck.

369
00:41:51,910 --> 00:41:58,310
But the evil mind that played with them like pawns had other aims and reasons.

370
00:41:58,310 --> 00:42:05,400
They must remain in the marshes by the bridge at least till British corpses should be a common sight there.

371
00:42:05,400 --> 00:42:13,990
Then for the last grand scene; the silver-haired soldier-saint would give up his shattered sword to save further slaughter.

372
00:42:13,990 --> 00:42:17,610
Oh, it was well organised for an impromptu.

373
00:42:17,610 --> 00:42:29,060
But I think (I cannot prove), I think that it was while they stuck there in the bloody mire that someone doubted—and someone guessed.”

374
00:42:29,060 --> 00:42:41,040
He was mute a moment, and then said: “There is a voice from nowhere that tells me the man who guessed was the lover... the man to wed the old man’s child.”

375
00:42:41,040 --> 00:42:43,270
“But what about Olivier and the hanging?”

376
00:42:43,270 --> 00:42:45,020
asked Flambeau.

377
00:42:45,020 --> 00:42:54,110
“Olivier, partly from chivalry, partly from policy, seldom encumbered his march with captives,” explained the narrator.

378
00:42:54,110 --> 00:42:57,090
“He released everybody in most cases.

379
00:42:57,090 --> 00:42:59,690
He released everybody in this case.”

380
00:42:59,690 --> 00:43:03,220
“Everybody but the general,” said the tall man.

381
00:43:03,220 --> 00:43:06,410
“Everybody,” said the priest.

382
00:43:06,410 --> 00:43:09,240
Flambeau knit his black brows.

383
00:43:09,240 --> 00:43:12,840
“I don’t grasp it all yet,” he said.

384
00:43:12,840 --> 00:43:18,960
“There is another picture, Flambeau,” said Brown in his more mystical undertone.

385
00:43:18,960 --> 00:43:23,610
“I can’t prove it; but I can do more—I can see it.

386
00:43:23,610 --> 00:43:33,200
There is a camp breaking up on the bare, torrid hills at morning, and Brazilian uniforms massed in blocks and columns to march.

387
00:43:33,200 --> 00:43:42,370
There is the red shirt and long black beard of Olivier, which blows as he stands, his broad-brimmed hat in his hand.

388
00:43:42,370 --> 00:43:51,860
He is saying farewell to the great enemy he is setting free—the simple, snow-headed English veteran, who thanks him in the name of his men.

389
00:43:51,860 --> 00:43:59,120
The English remnant stand behind at attention; beside them are stores and vehicles for the retreat.

390
00:43:59,120 --> 00:44:05,360
The drums roll; the Brazilians are moving; the English are still like statues.

391
00:44:05,360 --> 00:44:12,020
So they abide till the last hum and flash of the enemy have faded from the tropic horizon.

392
00:44:12,020 --> 00:44:24,650
Then they alter their postures all at once, like dead men coming to life; they turn their fifty faces upon the general—faces not to be forgotten.”

393
00:44:24,650 --> 00:44:27,040
Flambeau gave a great jump.

394
00:44:27,040 --> 00:44:31,000
“Ah,” he cried, “you don’t mean—”

395
00:44:31,000 --> 00:44:35,440
“Yes,” said Father Brown in a deep, moving voice.

396
00:44:35,440 --> 00:44:39,420
“It was an English hand that put the rope round St.

397
00:44:39,420 --> 00:44:44,370
Clare’s neck; I believe the hand that put the ring on his daughter’s finger.

398
00:44:44,370 --> 00:44:52,830
They were English hands that dragged him up to the tree of shame; the hands of men that had adored him and followed him to victory.

399
00:44:52,830 --> 00:44:58,100
And they were English souls (God pardon and endure us all!)

400
00:44:58,100 --> 00:45:10,340
who stared at him swinging in that foreign sun on the green gallows of palm, and prayed in their hatred that he might drop off it into hell.”

401
00:45:10,340 --> 00:45:17,690
As the two topped the ridge there burst on them the strong scarlet light of a red-curtained English inn.

402
00:45:17,690 --> 00:45:24,470
It stood sideways in the road, as if standing aside in the amplitude of hospitality.

403
00:45:24,470 --> 00:45:34,600
Its three doors stood open with invitation; and even where they stood they could hear the hum and laughter of humanity happy for a night.

404
00:45:35,660 --> 00:45:38,800
“I need not tell you more,” said Father Brown.

405
00:45:38,800 --> 00:45:53,310
“They tried him in the wilderness and destroyed him; and then, for the honour of England and of his daughter, they took an oath to seal up for ever the story of the traitor’s purse and the assassin’s sword blade.

406
00:45:53,310 --> 00:45:57,160
Perhaps—Heaven help them—they tried to forget it.

407
00:45:57,160 --> 00:46:00,730
Let us try to forget it, anyhow; here is our inn.”

408
00:46:00,730 --> 00:46:11,110
“With all my heart,” said Flambeau, and was just striding into the bright, noisy bar when he stepped back and almost fell on the road.

409
00:46:11,110 --> 00:46:13,510
“Look there, in the devil’s name!”

410
00:46:13,510 --> 00:46:19,870
he cried, and pointed rigidly at the square wooden sign that overhung the road.

411
00:46:19,870 --> 00:46:32,440
It showed dimly the crude shape of a sabre hilt and a shortened blade; and was inscribed in false archaic lettering, “The Sign of the Broken Sword.”

412
00:46:32,440 --> 00:46:34,710
“Were you not prepared?”

413
00:46:34,710 --> 00:46:36,510
asked Father Brown gently.

414
00:46:36,510 --> 00:46:43,250
“He is the god of this country; half the inns and parks and streets are named after him and his story.”

415
00:46:43,250 --> 00:46:49,020
“I thought we had done with the leper,” cried Flambeau, and spat on the road.

416
00:46:49,020 --> 00:46:56,620
“You will never have done with him in England,” said the priest, looking down, “while brass is strong and stone abides.

417
00:46:56,620 --> 00:47:06,880
His marble statues will erect the souls of proud, innocent boys for centuries, his village tomb will smell of loyalty as of lilies.

418
00:47:06,880 --> 00:47:15,930
Millions who never knew him shall love him like a father—this man whom the last few that knew him dealt with like dung.

419
00:47:15,930 --> 00:47:23,830
He shall be a saint; and the truth shall never be told of him, because I have made up my mind at last.

420
00:47:23,830 --> 00:47:30,500
There is so much good and evil in breaking secrets, that I put my conduct to a test.

421
00:47:30,500 --> 00:47:38,610
All these newspapers will perish; the anti-Brazil boom is already over; Olivier is already honoured everywhere.

422
00:47:38,610 --> 00:47:54,830
But I told myself that if anywhere, by name, in metal or marble that will endure like the pyramids, Colonel Clancy, or Captain Keith, or President Olivier, or any innocent man was wrongly blamed, then I would speak.

423
00:47:54,830 --> 00:47:56,540
If it were only that St.

424
00:47:56,540 --> 00:48:00,230
Clare was wrongly praised, I would be silent.

425
00:48:00,230 --> 00:48:01,790
And I will.”

426
00:48:01,790 --> 00:48:09,290
They plunged into the red-curtained tavern, which was not only cosy, but even luxurious inside.

427
00:48:09,290 --> 00:48:12,530
On a table stood a silver model of the tomb of St.

428
00:48:12,530 --> 00:48:17,890
Clare, the silver head bowed, the silver sword broken.

429
00:48:17,890 --> 00:48:25,020
On the walls were coloured photographs of the same scene, and of the system of wagonettes that took tourists to see it.

430
00:48:25,020 --> 00:48:28,530
They sat down on the comfortable padded benches.

431
00:48:28,530 --> 00:48:33,570
“Come, it’s cold,” cried Father Brown; “let us have some wine or beer.”

432
00:48:33,570 --> 00:48:36,780
“Or brandy,” said Flambeau.

433
00:48:38,280 --> 00:48:39,250
