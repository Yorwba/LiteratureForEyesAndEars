Chapter 1

9
00:00:28,430 --> 00:00:35,480
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PASSEPARTOUT ACCEPT EACH OTHER, THE ONE AS MASTER, THE OTHER AS MAN

10
00:00:36,140 --> 00:00:39,740
Mr. Phileas Fogg lived, in 1872, at No.

11
00:00:39,760 --> 00:00:45,920
7, Saville Row, Burlington Gardens, the house in which Sheridan died in 1814.

12
00:00:46,660 --> 00:01:00,020
He was one of the most noticeable members of the Reform Club, though he seemed always to avoid attracting attention; an enigmatical personage, about whom little was known, except that he was a polished man of the world.

13
00:01:00,760 --> 00:01:11,500
People said that he resembled Byron--at least that his head was Byronic; but he was a bearded, tranquil Byron, who might live on a thousand years without growing old.

14
00:01:12,100 --> 00:01:16,920
Certainly an Englishman, it was more doubtful whether Phileas Fogg was a Londoner.

15
00:01:17,520 --> 00:01:44,160
He was never seen on 'Change, nor at the Bank, nor in the counting-rooms of the "City"; no ships ever came into London docks of which he was the owner; he had no public employment; he had never been entered at any of the Inns of Court, either at the Temple, or Lincoln's Inn, or Gray's Inn; nor had his voice ever resounded in the Court of Chancery, or in the Exchequer, or the Queen's Bench, or the Ecclesiastical Courts.

16
00:01:44,780 --> 00:01:49,740
He certainly was not a manufacturer; nor was he a merchant or a gentleman farmer.

17
00:01:50,300 --> 00:02:05,480
His name was strange to the scientific and learned societies, and he never was known to take part in the sage deliberations of the Royal Institution or the London Institution, the Artisan's Association, or the Institution of Arts and Sciences.

18
00:02:06,180 --> 00:02:17,920
He belonged, in fact, to none of the numerous societies which swarm in the English capital, from the Harmonic to that of the Entomologists, founded mainly for the purpose of abolishing pernicious insects.

19
00:02:18,480 --> 00:02:22,080
Phileas Fogg was a member of the Reform, and that was all.

20
00:02:22,100 --> 00:02:26,860
The way in which he got admission to this exclusive club was simple enough.

21
00:02:27,200 --> 00:02:30,920
He was recommended by the Barings, with whom he had an open credit.

22
00:02:31,440 --> 00:02:36,760
His cheques were regularly paid at sight from his account current, which was always flush.

23
00:02:37,380 --> 00:02:38,640
Was Phileas Fogg rich?

24
00:02:39,060 --> 00:02:39,660
Undoubtedly.

25
00:02:40,260 --> 00:02:49,020
But those who knew him best could not imagine how he had made his fortune, and Mr. Fogg was the last person to whom to apply for the information.

26
00:02:49,820 --> 00:03:02,020
He was not lavish, nor, on the contrary, avaricious; for, whenever he knew that money was needed for a noble, useful, or benevolent purpose, he supplied it quietly and sometimes anonymously.

27
00:03:02,880 --> 00:03:05,900
He was, in short, the least communicative of men.

28
00:03:06,640 --> 00:03:11,100
He talked very little, and seemed all the more mysterious for his taciturn manner.

29
00:03:12,020 --> 00:03:22,900
His daily habits were quite open to observation; but whatever he did was so exactly the same thing that he had always done before, that the wits of the curious were fairly puzzled.

30
00:03:23,600 --> 00:03:24,260
Had he travelled?

31
00:03:24,660 --> 00:03:34,220
It was likely, for no one seemed to know the world more familiarly; there was no spot so secluded that he did not appear to have an intimate acquaintance with it.

32
00:03:35,120 --> 00:03:53,000
He often corrected, with a few clear words, the thousand conjectures advanced by members of the club as to lost and unheard-of travellers, pointing out the true probabilities, and seeming as if gifted with a sort of second sight, so often did events justify his predictions.

33
00:03:53,660 --> 00:03:57,100
He must have travelled everywhere, at least in the spirit.

34
00:03:58,020 --> 00:04:04,160
It was at least certain that Phileas Fogg had not absented himself from London for many years.

35
00:04:04,860 --> 00:04:12,580
Those who were honoured by a better acquaintance with him than the rest, declared that nobody could pretend to have ever seen him anywhere else.

36
00:04:12,600 --> 00:04:16,600
His sole pastimes were reading the papers and playing whist.

37
00:04:17,000 --> 00:04:27,280
He often won at this game, which, as a silent one, harmonised with his nature; but his winnings never went into his purse, being reserved as a fund for his charities.

38
00:04:28,060 --> 00:04:31,900
Mr. Fogg played, not to win, but for the sake of playing.

39
00:04:32,420 --> 00:04:41,800
The game was in his eyes a contest, a struggle with a difficulty, yet a motionless, unwearying struggle, congenial to his tastes.

40
00:04:42,620 --> 00:04:52,920
Phileas Fogg was not known to have either wife or children, which may happen to the most honest people; either relatives or near friends, which is certainly more unusual.

41
00:04:53,740 --> 00:04:57,940
He lived alone in his house in Saville Row, whither none penetrated.

42
00:04:58,520 --> 00:05:01,000
A single domestic sufficed to serve him.

43
00:05:01,420 --> 00:05:19,300
He breakfasted and dined at the club, at hours mathematically fixed, in the same room, at the same table, never taking his meals with other members, much less bringing a guest with him; and went home at exactly midnight, only to retire at once to bed.

44
00:05:20,340 --> 00:05:25,100
He never used the cosy chambers which the Reform provides for its favoured members.

45
00:05:25,700 --> 00:05:31,880
He passed ten hours out of the twenty-four in Saville Row, either in sleeping or making his toilet.

46
00:05:32,820 --> 00:05:47,880
When he chose to take a walk it was with a regular step in the entrance hall with its mosaic flooring, or in the circular gallery with its dome supported by twenty red porphyry Ionic columns, and illumined by blue painted windows.

47
00:05:48,680 --> 00:06:25,020
When he breakfasted or dined all the resources of the club--its kitchens and pantries, its buttery and dairy--aided to crowd his table with their most succulent stores; he was served by the gravest waiters, in dress coats, and shoes with swan-skin soles, who proffered the viands in special porcelain, and on the finest linen; club decanters, of a lost mould, contained his sherry, his port, and his cinnamon-spiced claret; while his beverages were refreshingly cooled with ice, brought at great cost from the American lakes.

48
00:06:26,020 --> 00:06:33,480
If to live in this style is to be eccentric, it must be confessed that there is something good in eccentricity.

49
00:06:34,360 --> 00:06:39,220
The mansion in Saville Row, though not sumptuous, was exceedingly comfortable.

50
00:06:39,900 --> 00:06:50,120
The habits of its occupant were such as to demand but little from the sole domestic, but Phileas Fogg required him to be almost superhumanly prompt and regular.

51
00:06:50,900 --> 00:07:09,060
On this very 2nd of October he had dismissed James Forster, because that luckless youth had brought him shaving-water at eighty-four degrees Fahrenheit instead of eighty-six; and he was awaiting his successor, who was due at the house between eleven and half-past.

52
00:07:09,940 --> 00:07:32,180
Phileas Fogg was seated squarely in his armchair, his feet close together like those of a grenadier on parade, his hands resting on his knees, his body straight, his head erect; he was steadily watching a complicated clock which indicated the hours, the minutes, the seconds, the days, the months, and the years.

53
00:07:32,200 --> 00:07:39,740
At exactly half-past eleven Mr. Fogg would, according to his daily habit, quit Saville Row, and repair to the Reform.

54
00:07:40,480 --> 00:07:49,360
A rap at this moment sounded on the door of the cosy apartment where Phileas Fogg was seated, and James Forster, the dismissed servant, appeared.

55
00:07:49,980 --> 00:07:51,320
"The new servant," said he.

56
00:07:51,960 --> 00:07:54,200
A young man of thirty advanced and bowed.

57
00:07:55,020 --> 00:07:59,880
"You are a Frenchman, I believe," asked Phileas Fogg, "and your name is John?"

58
00:08:00,480 --> 00:08:13,300
"Jean, if monsieur pleases," replied the newcomer, "Jean Passepartout, a surname which has clung to me because I have a natural aptness for going out of one business into another.

59
00:08:13,920 --> 00:08:19,160
I believe I'm honest, monsieur, but, to be outspoken, I've had several trades.

60
00:08:19,180 --> 00:08:26,520
I've been an itinerant singer, a circus-rider, when I used to vault like Leotard, and dance on a rope like Blondin.

61
00:08:27,280 --> 00:08:37,960
Then I got to be a professor of gymnastics, so as to make better use of my talents; and then I was a sergeant fireman at Paris, and assisted at many a big fire.

62
00:08:38,740 --> 00:08:47,600
But I quitted France five years ago, and, wishing to taste the sweets of domestic life, took service as a valet here in England.

63
00:08:47,780 --> 00:09:04,040
Finding myself out of place, and hearing that Monsieur Phileas Fogg was the most exact and settled gentleman in the United Kingdom, I have come to monsieur in the hope of living with him a tranquil life, and forgetting even the name of Passepartout."

64
00:09:04,740 --> 00:09:07,840
"Passepartout suits me," responded Mr. Fogg.

65
00:09:08,360 --> 00:09:11,720
"You are well recommended to me; I hear a good report of you.

66
00:09:12,340 --> 00:09:13,480
You know my conditions?"

67
00:09:14,280 --> 00:09:15,140
"Yes, monsieur."

68
00:09:16,040 --> 00:09:16,380
"Good!

69
00:09:16,820 --> 00:09:17,560
What time is it?"

70
00:09:18,200 --> 00:09:25,100
"Twenty-two minutes after eleven," returned Passepartout, drawing an enormous silver watch from the depths of his pocket.

71
00:09:25,580 --> 00:09:27,460
"You are too slow," said Mr. Fogg.

72
00:09:28,240 --> 00:09:31,240
"Pardon me, monsieur, it is impossible--"

73
00:09:31,280 --> 00:09:33,200
"You are four minutes too slow.

74
00:09:33,900 --> 00:09:36,180
No matter; it's enough to mention the error.

75
00:09:37,120 --> 00:09:44,820
Now from this moment, twenty-nine minutes after eleven, a.m., this Wednesday, 2nd October, you are in my service."

76
00:09:45,700 --> 00:09:54,420
Phileas Fogg got up, took his hat in his left hand, put it on his head with an automatic motion, and went off without a word.

77
00:09:54,620 --> 00:09:59,940
Passepartout heard the street door shut once; it was his new master going out.

78
00:10:00,800 --> 00:10:06,440
He heard it shut again; it was his predecessor, James Forster, departing in his turn.

79
00:10:07,220 --> 00:10:12,300
Passepartout remained alone in the house in Saville Row.

80
00:10:12,330 --> 00:10:14,240

00:10:26,790 --> 00:10:31,100
Around the World in Eighty Days
by
Jules Verne

84
00:10:31,100 --> 00:10:34,370
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

85
00:10:34,370 --> 00:10:35,870
Chapter 2

86
00:10:35,870 --> 00:10:40,820
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS CONVINCED THAT HE HAS AT LAST FOUND HIS IDEAL

87
00:10:41,240 --> 00:10:49,000
"Faith," muttered Passepartout, somewhat flurried, "I've seen people at Madame Tussaud's as lively as my new master!"

88
00:10:49,680 --> 00:10:59,020
Madame Tussaud's "people," let it be said, are of wax, and are much visited in London; speech is all that is wanting to make them human.

89
00:10:59,720 --> 00:11:04,660
During his brief interview with Mr. Fogg, Passepartout had been carefully observing him.

90
00:11:04,660 --> 00:11:21,140
He appeared to be a man about forty years of age, with fine, handsome features, and a tall, well-shaped figure; his hair and whiskers were light, his forehead compact and unwrinkled, his face rather pale, his teeth magnificent.

91
00:11:21,160 --> 00:11:30,700
His countenance possessed in the highest degree what physiognomists call "repose in action," a quality of those who act rather than talk.

92
00:11:31,460 --> 00:11:42,360
Calm and phlegmatic, with a clear eye, Mr. Fogg seemed a perfect type of that English composure which Angelica Kauffmann has so skilfully represented on canvas.

93
00:11:42,920 --> 00:11:53,080
Seen in the various phases of his daily life, he gave the idea of being perfectly well-balanced, as exactly regulated as a Leroy chronometer.

94
00:11:53,900 --> 00:12:09,260
Phileas Fogg was, indeed, exactitude personified, and this was betrayed even in the expression of his very hands and feet; for in men, as well as in animals, the limbs themselves are expressive of the passions.

95
00:12:10,180 --> 00:12:17,780
He was so exact that he was never in a hurry, was always ready, and was economical alike of his steps and his motions.

96
00:12:18,480 --> 00:12:29,720
He never took one step too many, and always went to his destination by the shortest cut; he made no superfluous gestures, and was never seen to be moved or agitated.

97
00:12:30,540 --> 00:12:36,880
He was the most deliberate person in the world, yet always reached his destination at the exact moment.

98
00:12:37,720 --> 00:12:51,020
He lived alone, and, so to speak, outside of every social relation; and as he knew that in this world account must be taken of friction, and that friction retards, he never rubbed against anybody.

99
00:12:52,080 --> 00:12:55,459
As for Passepartout, he was a true Parisian of Paris.

100
00:12:56,060 --> 00:13:04,600
Since he had abandoned his own country for England, taking service as a valet, he had in vain searched for a master after his own heart.

101
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:27,280
Passepartout was by no means one of those pert dunces depicted by Moliere with a bold gaze and a nose held high in the air; he was an honest fellow, with a pleasant face, lips a trifle protruding, soft-mannered and serviceable, with a good round head, such as one likes to see on the shoulders of a friend.

102
00:13:27,980 --> 00:13:41,580
His eyes were blue, his complexion rubicund, his figure almost portly and well-built, his body muscular, and his physical powers fully developed by the exercises of his younger days.

103
00:13:42,200 --> 00:13:58,040
His brown hair was somewhat tumbled; for, while the ancient sculptors are said to have known eighteen methods of arranging Minerva's tresses, Passepartout was familiar with but one of dressing his own: three strokes of a large-tooth comb completed his toilet.

104
00:13:59,040 --> 00:14:04,560
It would be rash to predict how Passepartout's lively nature would agree with Mr. Fogg.

105
00:14:05,139 --> 00:14:14,700
It was impossible to tell whether the new servant would turn out as absolutely methodical as his master required; experience alone could solve the question.

106
00:14:15,720 --> 00:14:28,259
Passepartout had been a sort of vagrant in his early years, and now yearned for repose; but so far he had failed to find it, though he had already served in ten English houses.

107
00:14:28,700 --> 00:14:40,640
But he could not take root in any of these; with chagrin, he found his masters invariably whimsical and irregular, constantly running about the country, or on the look-out for adventure.

108
00:14:41,459 --> 00:14:52,100
His last master, young Lord Longferry, Member of Parliament, after passing his nights in the Haymarket taverns, was too often brought home in the morning on policemen's shoulders.

109
00:14:52,660 --> 00:15:02,640
Passepartout, desirous of respecting the gentleman whom he served, ventured a mild remonstrance on such conduct; which, being ill-received, he took his leave.

110
00:15:03,740 --> 00:15:18,880
Hearing that Mr. Phileas Fogg was looking for a servant, and that his life was one of unbroken regularity, that he neither travelled nor stayed from home overnight, he felt sure that this would be the place he was after.

111
00:15:18,899 --> 00:15:22,480
He presented himself, and was accepted, as has been seen.

112
00:15:23,640 --> 00:15:29,059
At half-past eleven, then, Passepartout found himself alone in the house in Saville Row.

113
00:15:29,740 --> 00:15:34,360
He began its inspection without delay, scouring it from cellar to garret.

114
00:15:34,980 --> 00:15:46,080
So clean, well-arranged, solemn a mansion pleased him; it seemed to him like a snail's shell, lighted and warmed by gas, which sufficed for both these purposes.

115
00:15:47,040 --> 00:15:55,600
When Passepartout reached the second story he recognised at once the room which he was to inhabit, and he was well satisfied with it.

116
00:15:56,179 --> 00:16:12,140
Electric bells and speaking-tubes afforded communication with the lower stories; while on the mantel stood an electric clock, precisely like that in Mr. Fogg's bedchamber, both beating the same second at the same instant.

117
00:16:12,680 --> 00:16:16,600
"That's good, that'll do," said Passepartout to himself.

118
00:16:17,400 --> 00:16:26,100
He suddenly observed, hung over the clock, a card which, upon inspection, proved to be a programme of the daily routine of the house.

119
00:16:26,720 --> 00:16:52,700
It comprised all that was required of the servant, from eight in the morning, exactly at which hour Phileas Fogg rose, till half-past eleven, when he left the house for the Reform Club--all the details of service, the tea and toast at twenty-three minutes past eight, the shaving-water at thirty-seven minutes past nine, and the toilet at twenty minutes before ten.

120
00:16:52,720 --> 00:17:02,499
Everything was regulated and foreseen that was to be done from half-past eleven a.m. till midnight, the hour at which the methodical gentleman retired.

121
00:17:03,680 --> 00:17:08,640
Mr. Fogg's wardrobe was amply supplied and in the best taste.

122
00:17:08,659 --> 00:17:22,060
Each pair of trousers, coat, and vest bore a number, indicating the time of year and season at which they were in turn to be laid out for wearing; and the same system was applied to the master's shoes.

123
00:17:22,640 --> 00:17:35,220
In short, the house in Saville Row, which must have been a very temple of disorder and unrest under the illustrious but dissipated Sheridan, was cosiness, comfort, and method idealised.

124
00:17:36,000 --> 00:17:48,640
There was no study, nor were there books, which would have been quite useless to Mr. Fogg; for at the Reform two libraries, one of general literature and the other of law and politics, were at his service.

125
00:17:49,380 --> 00:18:04,920
A moderate-sized safe stood in his bedroom, constructed so as to defy fire as well as burglars; but Passepartout found neither arms nor hunting weapons anywhere; everything betrayed the most tranquil and peaceable habits.

126
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:16,540
Having scrutinised the house from top to bottom, he rubbed his hands, a broad smile overspread his features, and he said joyfully, "This is just what I wanted!

127
00:18:16,560 --> 00:18:19,460
Ah, we shall get on together, Mr. Fogg and I!

128
00:18:19,860 --> 00:18:22,120
What a domestic and regular gentleman!

129
00:18:22,640 --> 00:18:26,560

Chapter 3

136
00:18:51,570 --> 00:18:57,660
IN WHICH A CONVERSATION TAKES PLACE WHICH SEEMS LIKELY TO COST PHILEAS FOGG DEAR

137
00:18:58,160 --> 00:19:18,720
Phileas Fogg, having shut the door of his house at half-past eleven, and having put his right foot before his left five hundred and seventy-five times, and his left foot before his right five hundred and seventy-six times, reached the Reform Club, an imposing edifice in Pall Mall, which could not have cost less than three millions.

138
00:19:19,440 --> 00:19:34,280
He repaired at once to the dining-room, the nine windows of which open upon a tasteful garden, where the trees were already gilded with an autumn colouring; and took his place at the habitual table, the cover of which had already been laid for him.

139
00:19:35,180 --> 00:19:54,659
His breakfast consisted of a side-dish, a broiled fish with Reading sauce, a scarlet slice of roast beef garnished with mushrooms, a rhubarb and gooseberry tart, and a morsel of Cheshire cheese, the whole being washed down with several cups of tea, for which the Reform is famous.

140
00:19:55,260 --> 00:20:04,440
He rose at thirteen minutes to one, and directed his steps towards the large hall, a sumptuous apartment adorned with lavishly-framed paintings.

141
00:20:05,120 --> 00:20:13,760
A flunkey handed him an uncut Times, which he proceeded to cut with a skill which betrayed familiarity with this delicate operation.

142
00:20:14,019 --> 00:20:24,360
The perusal of this paper absorbed Phileas Fogg until a quarter before four, whilst the Standard, his next task, occupied him till the dinner hour.

143
00:20:25,340 --> 00:20:33,740
Dinner passed as breakfast had done, and Mr. Fogg re-appeared in the reading-room and sat down to the Pall Mall at twenty minutes before six.

144
00:20:34,380 --> 00:20:41,840
Half an hour later several members of the Reform came in and drew up to the fireplace, where a coal fire was steadily burning.

145
00:20:42,580 --> 00:21:06,220
They were Mr. Fogg's usual partners at whist: Andrew Stuart, an engineer; John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, bankers; Thomas Flanagan, a brewer; and Gauthier Ralph, one of the Directors of the Bank of England--all rich and highly respectable personages, even in a club which comprises the princes of English trade and finance.

146
00:21:06,980 --> 00:21:10,560
"Well, Ralph," said Thomas Flanagan, "what about that robbery?"

147
00:21:11,120 --> 00:21:14,220
"Oh," replied Stuart, "the Bank will lose the money."

148
00:21:14,720 --> 00:21:19,400
"On the contrary," broke in Ralph, "I hope we may put our hands on the robber.

149
00:21:19,860 --> 00:21:28,460
Skilful detectives have been sent to all the principal ports of America and the Continent, and he'll be a clever fellow if he slips through their fingers."

150
00:21:29,160 --> 00:21:31,120
"But have you got the robber's description?"

151
00:21:31,140 --> 00:21:31,800
asked Stuart.

152
00:21:32,460 --> 00:21:36,560
"In the first place, he is no robber at all," returned Ralph, positively.

153
00:21:37,180 --> 00:21:37,520
"What!

154
00:21:37,539 --> 00:21:41,040
a fellow who makes off with fifty-five thousand pounds, no robber?"

155
00:21:41,640 --> 00:21:42,060
"No."

156
00:21:42,820 --> 00:21:44,580
"Perhaps he's a manufacturer, then."

157
00:21:45,420 --> 00:21:47,920
"The Daily Telegraph says that he is a gentleman."

158
00:21:48,659 --> 00:21:53,580
It was Phileas Fogg, whose head now emerged from behind his newspapers, who made this remark.

159
00:21:54,300 --> 00:21:57,220
He bowed to his friends, and entered into the conversation.

160
00:21:57,779 --> 00:22:04,160
The affair which formed its subject, and which was town talk, had occurred three days before at the Bank of England.

161
00:22:04,820 --> 00:22:18,360
A package of banknotes, to the value of fifty-five thousand pounds, had been taken from the principal cashier's table, that functionary being at the moment engaged in registering the receipt of three shillings and sixpence.

162
00:22:18,780 --> 00:22:20,980
Of course, he could not have his eyes everywhere.

163
00:22:21,600 --> 00:22:27,380
Let it be observed that the Bank of England reposes a touching confidence in the honesty of the public.

164
00:22:27,900 --> 00:22:36,840
There are neither guards nor gratings to protect its treasures; gold, silver, banknotes are freely exposed, at the mercy of the first comer.

165
00:22:37,560 --> 00:22:48,500
A keen observer of English customs relates that, being in one of the rooms of the Bank one day, he had the curiosity to examine a gold ingot weighing some seven or eight pounds.

166
00:22:48,560 --> 00:23:02,640
He took it up, scrutinised it, passed it to his neighbour, he to the next man, and so on until the ingot, going from hand to hand, was transferred to the end of a dark entry; nor did it return to its place for half an hour.

167
00:23:03,460 --> 00:23:07,100
Meanwhile, the cashier had not so much as raised his head.

168
00:23:07,299 --> 00:23:10,860
But in the present instance things had not gone so smoothly.

169
00:23:11,480 --> 00:23:21,420
The package of notes not being found when five o'clock sounded from the ponderous clock in the "drawing office," the amount was passed to the account of profit and loss.

170
00:23:22,300 --> 00:23:39,400
As soon as the robbery was discovered, picked detectives hastened off to Liverpool, Glasgow, Havre, Suez, Brindisi, New York, and other ports, inspired by the proffered reward of two thousand pounds, and five per cent. on the sum that might be recovered.

171
00:23:40,080 --> 00:23:49,200
Detectives were also charged with narrowly watching those who arrived at or left London by rail, and a judicial examination was at once entered upon.

172
00:23:50,160 --> 00:23:57,860
There were real grounds for supposing, as the Daily Telegraph said, that the thief did not belong to a professional band.

173
00:23:57,880 --> 00:24:08,220
On the day of the robbery a well-dressed gentleman of polished manners, and with a well-to-do air, had been observed going to and fro in the paying room where the crime was committed.

174
00:24:08,520 --> 00:24:18,460
A description of him was easily procured and sent to the detectives; and some hopeful spirits, of whom Ralph was one, did not despair of his apprehension.

175
00:24:19,280 --> 00:24:32,680
The papers and clubs were full of the affair, and everywhere people were discussing the probabilities of a successful pursuit; and the Reform Club was especially agitated, several of its members being Bank officials.

176
00:24:33,440 --> 00:24:43,299
Ralph would not concede that the work of the detectives was likely to be in vain, for he thought that the prize offered would greatly stimulate their zeal and activity.

177
00:24:43,820 --> 00:24:52,060
But Stuart was far from sharing this confidence; and, as they placed themselves at the whist-table, they continued to argue the matter.

178
00:24:52,419 --> 00:24:58,240
Stuart and Flanagan played together, while Phileas Fogg had Fallentin for his partner.

179
00:24:58,920 --> 00:25:04,740
As the game proceeded the conversation ceased, excepting between the rubbers, when it revived again.

180
00:25:05,560 --> 00:25:12,320
"I maintain," said Stuart, "that the chances are in favour of the thief, who must be a shrewd fellow."

181
00:25:13,180 --> 00:25:14,640
"Well, but where can he fly to?"

182
00:25:15,040 --> 00:25:15,740
asked Ralph.

183
00:25:16,060 --> 00:25:17,580
"No country is safe for him."

184
00:25:18,260 --> 00:25:18,760
"Pshaw!"

185
00:25:19,480 --> 00:25:20,419
"Where could he go, then?"

186
00:25:21,120 --> 00:25:22,520
"Oh, I don't know that.

187
00:25:22,880 --> 00:25:24,120
The world is big enough."

188
00:25:24,740 --> 00:25:27,900
"It was once," said Phileas Fogg, in a low tone.

189
00:25:28,600 --> 00:25:31,900
"Cut, sir," he added, handing the cards to Thomas Flanagan.

190
00:25:32,560 --> 00:25:36,600
The discussion fell during the rubber, after which Stuart took up its thread.

191
00:25:37,400 --> 00:25:39,120
"What do you mean by `once'?

192
00:25:39,520 --> 00:25:40,860
Has the world grown smaller?"

193
00:25:41,479 --> 00:25:43,080
"Certainly," returned Ralph.

194
00:25:43,480 --> 00:25:45,020
"I agree with Mr. Fogg.

195
00:25:45,080 --> 00:25:52,440
The world has grown smaller, since a man can now go round it ten times more quickly than a hundred years ago.

196
00:25:52,460 --> 00:25:56,080
And that is why the search for this thief will be more likely to succeed."

197
00:25:56,760 --> 00:25:59,600
"And also why the thief can get away more easily."

198
00:26:00,359 --> 00:26:03,680
"Be so good as to play, Mr. Stuart," said Phileas Fogg.

199
00:26:04,380 --> 00:26:13,240
But the incredulous Stuart was not convinced, and when the hand was finished, said eagerly: "You have a strange way, Ralph, of proving that the world has grown smaller.

200
00:26:13,840 --> 00:26:15,980
So, because you can go round it in three months--"

201
00:26:16,260 --> 00:26:19,000
"In eighty days," interrupted Phileas Fogg.

202
00:26:19,680 --> 00:26:22,000
"That is true, gentlemen," added John Sullivan.

203
00:26:22,419 --> 00:26:30,000
"Only eighty days, now that the section between Rothal and Allahabad, on the Great Indian Peninsula Railway, has been opened.

204
00:26:30,580 --> 00:26:33,200
Here is the estimate made by the Daily Telegraph:

205
00:26:33,799 --> 00:26:42,960
From London to Suez via Mont Cenis and Brindisi, by rail and steamboats .................  7 days From Suez to Bombay, by steamer ....................

206
00:26:43,299 --> 00:26:47,220
13  " From Bombay to Calcutta, by rail ...................

207
00:26:47,539 --> 00:26:51,399
3  " From Calcutta to Hong Kong, by steamer .............

208
00:26:51,680 --> 00:26:56,320
13  " From Hong Kong to Yokohama (Japan), by steamer .....

209
00:26:56,640 --> 00:27:00,960
6  " From Yokohama to San Francisco, by steamer .........

210
00:27:01,140 --> 00:27:05,760
22  " From San Francisco to New York, by rail .............

211
00:27:05,880 --> 00:27:10,119
7  " From New York to London, by steamer and rail ........

212
00:27:10,400 --> 00:27:13,200
9  " ------ Total ............................................ 80 days."

213
00:27:13,720 --> 00:27:15,520
"Yes, in eighty days!"

214
00:27:15,559 --> 00:27:18,899
exclaimed Stuart, who in his excitement made a false deal.

215
00:27:19,539 --> 00:27:26,100
"But that doesn't take into account bad weather, contrary winds, shipwrecks, railway accidents, and so on."

216
00:27:26,800 --> 00:27:31,840
"All included," returned Phileas Fogg, continuing to play despite the discussion.

217
00:27:32,419 --> 00:27:41,900
"But suppose the Hindoos or Indians pull up the rails," replied Stuart; "suppose they stop the trains, pillage the luggage-vans, and scalp the passengers!"

218
00:27:42,540 --> 00:27:48,500
"All included," calmly retorted Fogg; adding, as he threw down the cards, "Two trumps."

219
00:27:49,420 --> 00:27:56,920
Stuart, whose turn it was to deal, gathered them up, and went on: "You are right, theoretically, Mr. Fogg, but practically--"

220
00:27:57,240 --> 00:27:59,080
"Practically also, Mr. Stuart."

221
00:27:59,920 --> 00:28:02,119
"I'd like to see you do it in eighty days."

222
00:28:02,680 --> 00:28:03,660
"It depends on you.

223
00:28:03,980 --> 00:28:04,659
Shall we go?"

224
00:28:05,220 --> 00:28:06,240
"Heaven preserve me!

225
00:28:06,500 --> 00:28:12,179
But I would wager four thousand pounds that such a journey, made under these conditions, is impossible."

226
00:28:12,740 --> 00:28:15,779
"Quite possible, on the contrary," returned Mr. Fogg.

227
00:28:16,460 --> 00:28:17,620
"Well, make it, then!"

228
00:28:18,300 --> 00:28:20,419
"The journey round the world in eighty days?"

229
00:28:20,860 --> 00:28:21,460
"Yes."

230
00:28:22,000 --> 00:28:23,520
"I should like nothing better."

231
00:28:24,200 --> 00:28:24,500
"When?"

232
00:28:25,280 --> 00:28:26,279
"At once.

233
00:28:26,300 --> 00:28:29,620
Only I warn you that I shall do it at your expense."

234
00:28:30,320 --> 00:28:31,340
"It's absurd!"

235
00:28:31,500 --> 00:28:35,420
cried Stuart, who was beginning to be annoyed at the persistency of his friend.

236
00:28:35,860 --> 00:28:37,720
"Come, let's go on with the game."

237
00:28:38,520 --> 00:28:40,760
"Deal over again, then," said Phileas Fogg.

238
00:28:41,200 --> 00:28:42,360
"There's a false deal."

239
00:28:42,960 --> 00:28:47,200
Stuart took up the pack with a feverish hand; then suddenly put them down again.

240
00:28:47,779 --> 00:28:53,639
"Well, Mr. Fogg," said he, "it shall be so: I will wager the four thousand on it."

241
00:28:54,380 --> 00:28:56,940
"Calm yourself, my dear Stuart," said Fallentin.

242
00:28:57,360 --> 00:28:58,659
"It's only a joke."

243
00:28:59,260 --> 00:29:02,360
"When I say I'll wager," returned Stuart, "I mean it."

244
00:29:03,020 --> 00:29:13,080
"All right," said Mr. Fogg; and, turning to the others, he continued: "I have a deposit of twenty thousand at Baring's which I will willingly risk upon it."

245
00:29:13,600 --> 00:29:15,380
"Twenty thousand pounds!"

246
00:29:15,640 --> 00:29:16,260
cried Sullivan.

247
00:29:16,700 --> 00:29:21,479
"Twenty thousand pounds, which you would lose by a single accidental delay!"

248
00:29:22,179 --> 00:29:26,820
"The unforeseen does not exist," quietly replied Phileas Fogg.

249
00:29:27,360 --> 00:29:33,340
"But, Mr. Fogg, eighty days are only the estimate of the least possible time in which the journey can be made."

250
00:29:34,040 --> 00:29:37,400
"A well-used minimum suffices for everything."

251
00:29:38,460 --> 00:29:46,140
"But, in order not to exceed it, you must jump mathematically from the trains upon the steamers, and from the steamers upon the trains again."

252
00:29:46,919 --> 00:29:48,840
"I will jump--mathematically."

253
00:29:49,479 --> 00:29:50,540
"You are joking."

254
00:29:51,180 --> 00:29:57,940
"A true Englishman doesn't joke when he is talking about so serious a thing as a wager," replied Phileas Fogg, solemnly.

255
00:29:58,620 --> 00:30:10,980
"I will bet twenty thousand pounds against anyone who wishes that I will make the tour of the world in eighty days or less; in nineteen hundred and twenty hours, or a hundred and fifteen thousand two hundred minutes.

256
00:30:11,580 --> 00:30:12,679
Do you accept?"

257
00:30:13,120 --> 00:30:15,120
"We accept," replied Messrs.

258
00:30:15,160 --> 00:30:19,260
Stuart, Fallentin, Sullivan, Flanagan, and Ralph, after consulting each other.

259
00:30:20,179 --> 00:30:21,560
"Good," said Mr. Fogg.

260
00:30:22,140 --> 00:30:25,040
"The train leaves for Dover at a quarter before nine.

261
00:30:25,500 --> 00:30:26,260
I will take it."

262
00:30:26,759 --> 00:30:28,000
"This very evening?"

263
00:30:28,019 --> 00:30:28,540
asked Stuart.

264
00:30:29,260 --> 00:30:31,900
"This very evening," returned Phileas Fogg.

265
00:30:32,359 --> 00:30:56,920
He took out and consulted a pocket almanac, and added,  "As today is Wednesday, the 2nd of October, I shall be due in London in this very room of the Reform Club, on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine p.m.; or else the twenty thousand pounds, now deposited in my name at Baring's, will belong to you, in fact and in right, gentlemen.

266
00:30:57,580 --> 00:30:59,299
Here is a cheque for the amount."

267
00:31:00,140 --> 00:31:08,620
A memorandum of the wager was at once drawn up and signed by the six parties, during which Phileas Fogg preserved a stoical composure.

268
00:31:09,520 --> 00:31:22,300
He certainly did not bet to win, and had only staked the twenty thousand pounds, half of his fortune, because he foresaw that he might have to expend the other half to carry out this difficult, not to say unattainable, project.

269
00:31:23,020 --> 00:31:34,640
As for his antagonists, they seemed much agitated; not so much by the value of their stake, as because they had some scruples about betting under conditions so difficult to their friend.

270
00:31:35,600 --> 00:31:42,620
The clock struck seven, and the party offered to suspend the game so that Mr. Fogg might make his preparations for departure.

271
00:31:43,340 --> 00:31:46,899
"I am quite ready now," was his tranquil response.

272
00:31:47,600 --> 00:31:51,080
"Diamonds are trumps: be so good as to play, gentlemen."

273
00:31:51,650 --> 00:31:54,380

Chapter 4

279
00:32:15,090 --> 00:32:19,480
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ASTOUNDS PASSEPARTOUT, HIS SERVANT

280
00:32:20,140 --> 00:32:28,380
Having won twenty guineas at whist, and taken leave of his friends, Phileas Fogg, at twenty-five minutes past seven, left the Reform Club.

281
00:32:29,020 --> 00:32:44,400
Passepartout, who had conscientiously studied the programme of his duties, was more than surprised to see his master guilty of the inexactness of appearing at this unaccustomed hour; for, according to rule, he was not due in Saville Row until precisely midnight.

282
00:32:45,320 --> 00:32:48,679
Mr. Fogg repaired to his bedroom, and called out, "Passepartout!"

283
00:32:49,820 --> 00:32:51,440
Passepartout did not reply.

284
00:32:51,860 --> 00:32:55,260
It could not be he who was called; it was not the right hour.

285
00:32:55,860 --> 00:32:56,600
"Passepartout!"

286
00:32:57,180 --> 00:32:59,680
repeated Mr. Fogg, without raising his voice.

287
00:33:00,200 --> 00:33:02,240
Passepartout made his appearance.

288
00:33:02,720 --> 00:33:05,280
"I've called you twice," observed his master.

289
00:33:05,660 --> 00:33:09,120
"But it is not midnight," responded the other, showing his watch.

290
00:33:09,820 --> 00:33:11,399
"I know it; I don't blame you.

291
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,880
We start for Dover and Calais in ten minutes."

292
00:33:15,380 --> 00:33:20,760
A puzzled grin overspread Passepartout's round face; clearly he had not comprehended his master.

293
00:33:21,280 --> 00:33:22,899
"Monsieur is going to leave home?"

294
00:33:23,520 --> 00:33:25,240
"Yes," returned Phileas Fogg.

295
00:33:25,720 --> 00:33:27,340
"We are going round the world."

296
00:33:28,000 --> 00:33:37,200
Passepartout opened wide his eyes, raised his eyebrows, held up his hands, and seemed about to collapse, so overcome was he with stupefied astonishment.

297
00:33:37,860 --> 00:33:39,360
"Round the world!"

298
00:33:39,559 --> 00:33:39,960
he murmured.

299
00:33:40,580 --> 00:33:43,120
"In eighty days," responded Mr. Fogg.

300
00:33:43,660 --> 00:33:45,040
"So we haven't a moment to lose."

301
00:33:45,059 --> 00:33:47,160
"But the trunks?"

302
00:33:47,299 --> 00:33:51,020
gasped Passepartout, unconsciously swaying his head from right to left.

303
00:33:51,559 --> 00:33:58,380
"We'll have no trunks; only a carpet-bag, with two shirts and three pairs of stockings for me, and the same for you.

304
00:33:59,140 --> 00:34:00,840
We'll buy our clothes on the way.

305
00:34:01,400 --> 00:34:07,320
Bring down my mackintosh and traveling-cloak, and some stout shoes, though we shall do little walking.

306
00:34:07,800 --> 00:34:08,400
Make haste!"

307
00:34:09,100 --> 00:34:11,780
Passepartout tried to reply, but could not.

308
00:34:11,840 --> 00:34:19,100
He went out, mounted to his own room, fell into a chair, and muttered: "That's good, that is!

309
00:34:19,120 --> 00:34:21,319
And I, who wanted to remain quiet!"

310
00:34:22,020 --> 00:34:26,179
He mechanically set about making the preparations for departure.

311
00:34:26,200 --> 00:34:28,339
Around the world in eighty days!

312
00:34:28,699 --> 00:34:30,040
Was his master a fool?

313
00:34:30,760 --> 00:34:31,239
No.

314
00:34:31,760 --> 00:34:33,020
Was this a joke, then?

315
00:34:33,540 --> 00:34:35,320
They were going to Dover; good!

316
00:34:35,840 --> 00:34:37,400
To Calais; good again!

317
00:34:37,920 --> 00:34:45,300
After all, Passepartout, who had been away from France five years, would not be sorry to set foot on his native soil again.

318
00:34:46,000 --> 00:34:51,260
Perhaps they would go as far as Paris, and it would do his eyes good to see Paris once more.

319
00:34:51,719 --> 00:35:02,300
But surely a gentleman so chary of his steps would stop there; no doubt--but, then, it was none the less true that he was going away, this so domestic person hitherto!

320
00:35:03,540 --> 00:35:16,120
By eight o'clock Passepartout had packed the modest carpet-bag, containing the wardrobes of his master and himself; then, still troubled in mind, he carefully shut the door of his room, and descended to Mr. Fogg.

321
00:35:17,120 --> 00:35:18,540
Mr. Fogg was quite ready.

322
00:35:19,100 --> 00:35:32,099
Under his arm might have been observed a red-bound copy of Bradshaw's Continental Railway Steam Transit and General Guide, with its timetables showing the arrival and departure of steamers and railways.

323
00:35:32,680 --> 00:35:39,859
He took the carpet-bag, opened it, and slipped into it a goodly roll of Bank of England notes, which would pass wherever he might go.

324
00:35:40,800 --> 00:35:42,220
"You have forgotten nothing?"

325
00:35:42,240 --> 00:35:42,700
asked he.

326
00:35:43,320 --> 00:35:44,359
"Nothing, monsieur."

327
00:35:44,940 --> 00:35:46,420
"My mackintosh and cloak?"

328
00:35:47,000 --> 00:35:47,720
"Here they are."

329
00:35:48,260 --> 00:35:48,540
"Good!

330
00:35:49,100 --> 00:35:52,120
Take this carpet-bag," handing it to Passepartout.

331
00:35:52,940 --> 00:35:56,660
"Take good care of it, for there are twenty thousand pounds in it."

332
00:35:57,660 --> 00:36:03,300
Passepartout nearly dropped the bag, as if the twenty thousand pounds were in gold, and weighed him down.

333
00:36:04,099 --> 00:36:12,920
Master and man then descended, the street-door was double-locked, and at the end of Saville Row they took a cab and drove rapidly to Charing Cross.

334
00:36:13,600 --> 00:36:17,560
The cab stopped before the railway station at twenty minutes past eight.

335
00:36:18,099 --> 00:36:40,140
Passepartout jumped off the box and followed his master, who, after paying the cabman, was about to enter the station, when a poor beggar-woman, with a child in her arms, her naked feet smeared with mud, her head covered with a wretched bonnet, from which hung a tattered feather, and her shoulders shrouded in a ragged shawl, approached, and mournfully asked for alms.

336
00:36:40,860 --> 00:36:48,440
Mr. Fogg took out the twenty guineas he had just won at whist, and handed them to the beggar, saying, "Here, my good woman.

337
00:36:48,460 --> 00:36:50,780
I'm glad that I met you;" and passed on.

338
00:36:51,420 --> 00:36:57,980
Passepartout had a moist sensation about the eyes; his master's action touched his susceptible heart.

339
00:36:58,980 --> 00:37:08,320
Two first-class tickets for Paris having been speedily purchased, Mr. Fogg was crossing the station to the train, when he perceived his five friends of the Reform.

340
00:37:08,839 --> 00:37:18,900
"Well, gentlemen," said he, "I'm off, you see; and, if you will examine my passport when I get back, you will be able to judge whether I have accomplished the journey agreed upon."

341
00:37:19,480 --> 00:37:23,660
"Oh, that would be quite unnecessary, Mr. Fogg," said Ralph politely.

342
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:26,640
"We will trust your word, as a gentleman of honour."

343
00:37:27,380 --> 00:37:30,800
"You do not forget when you are due in London again?"

344
00:37:30,820 --> 00:37:31,580
asked Stuart.

345
00:37:32,220 --> 00:37:39,600
"In eighty days; on Saturday, the 21st of December, 1872, at a quarter before nine p.m.

346
00:37:40,280 --> 00:37:41,260
Good-bye, gentlemen."

347
00:37:42,360 --> 00:37:53,360
Phileas Fogg and his servant seated themselves in a first-class carriage at twenty minutes before nine; five minutes later the whistle screamed, and the train slowly glided out of the station.

348
00:37:54,180 --> 00:37:57,300
The night was dark, and a fine, steady rain was falling.

349
00:37:57,820 --> 00:38:01,780
Phileas Fogg, snugly ensconced in his corner, did not open his lips.

350
00:38:02,320 --> 00:38:09,240
Passepartout, not yet recovered from his stupefaction, clung mechanically to the carpet-bag, with its enormous treasure.

351
00:38:10,099 --> 00:38:15,520
Just as the train was whirling through Sydenham, Passepartout suddenly uttered a cry of despair.

352
00:38:15,920 --> 00:38:16,720
"What's the matter?"

353
00:38:16,900 --> 00:38:17,920
asked Mr. Fogg.

354
00:38:18,280 --> 00:38:18,860
"Alas!

355
00:38:18,940 --> 00:38:20,960
In my hurry--I--I forgot--"

356
00:38:21,360 --> 00:38:21,799
"What?"

357
00:38:22,420 --> 00:38:24,080
"To turn off the gas in my room!"

358
00:38:24,960 --> 00:38:30,080
"Very well, young man," returned Mr. Fogg, coolly; "it will burn--at your expense."

359

Around the World in Eighty Days
by
Jules Verne

363
00:38:49,990 --> 00:38:53,150
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

364
00:38:53,150 --> 00:38:54,870
Chapter 5

365
00:38:54,870 --> 00:39:00,509
IN WHICH A NEW SPECIES OF FUNDS, UNKNOWN TO THE MONEYED MEN, APPEARS ON 'CHANGE

366
00:39:01,319 --> 00:39:07,740
Phileas Fogg rightly suspected that his departure from London would create a lively sensation at the West End.

367
00:39:08,460 --> 00:39:15,440
The news of the bet spread through the Reform Club, and afforded an exciting topic of conversation to its members.

368
00:39:16,000 --> 00:39:18,920
From the club it soon got into the papers throughout England.

369
00:39:19,480 --> 00:39:27,280
The boasted "tour of the world" was talked about, disputed, argued with as much warmth as if the subject were another Alabama claim.

370
00:39:27,880 --> 00:39:45,040
Some took sides with Phileas Fogg, but the large majority shook their heads and declared against him; it was absurd, impossible, they declared, that the tour of the world could be made, except theoretically and on paper, in this minimum of time, and with the existing means of travelling.

371
00:39:46,040 --> 00:39:58,720
The Times, Standard, Morning Post, and Daily News, and twenty other highly respectable newspapers scouted Mr. Fogg's project as madness; the Daily Telegraph alone hesitatingly supported him.

372
00:39:59,380 --> 00:40:08,500
People in general thought him a lunatic, and blamed his Reform Club friends for having accepted a wager which betrayed the mental aberration of its proposer.

373
00:40:09,500 --> 00:40:22,660
Articles no less passionate than logical appeared on the question, for geography is one of the pet subjects of the English; and the columns devoted to Phileas Fogg's venture were eagerly devoured by all classes of readers.

374
00:40:23,380 --> 00:40:36,260
At first some rash individuals, principally of the gentler sex, espoused his cause, which became still more popular when the Illustrated London News came out with his portrait, copied from a photograph in the Reform Club.

375
00:40:37,040 --> 00:40:41,319
A few readers of the Daily Telegraph even dared to say, "Why not, after all?

376
00:40:41,560 --> 00:40:43,700
Stranger things have come to pass."

377
00:40:44,839 --> 00:40:57,820
At last a long article appeared, on the 7th of October, in the bulletin of the Royal Geographical Society, which treated the question from every point of view, and demonstrated the utter folly of the enterprise.

378
00:40:58,440 --> 00:41:05,340
Everything, it said, was against the travellers, every obstacle imposed alike by man and by nature.

379
00:41:05,360 --> 00:41:13,020
A miraculous agreement of the times of departure and arrival, which was impossible, was absolutely necessary to his success.

380
00:41:13,480 --> 00:41:30,780
He might, perhaps, reckon on the arrival of trains at the designated hours, in Europe, where the distances were relatively moderate; but when he calculated upon crossing India in three days, and the United States in seven, could he rely beyond misgiving upon accomplishing his task?

381
00:41:31,420 --> 00:41:41,540
There were accidents to machinery, the liability of trains to run off the line, collisions, bad weather, the blocking up by snow--were not all these against Phileas Fogg?

382
00:41:42,400 --> 00:41:47,960
Would he not find himself, when travelling by steamer in winter, at the mercy of the winds and fogs?

383
00:41:48,620 --> 00:41:53,120
Is it uncommon for the best ocean steamers to be two or three days behind time?

384
00:41:53,920 --> 00:42:07,600
But a single delay would suffice to fatally break the chain of communication; should Phileas Fogg once miss, even by an hour; a steamer, he would have to wait for the next, and that would irrevocably render his attempt vain.

385
00:42:08,500 --> 00:42:16,080
This article made a great deal of noise, and, being copied into all the papers, seriously depressed the advocates of the rash tourist.

386
00:42:17,000 --> 00:42:24,800
Everybody knows that England is the world of betting men, who are of a higher class than mere gamblers; to bet is in the English temperament.

387
00:42:25,420 --> 00:42:35,200
Not only the members of the Reform, but the general public, made heavy wagers for or against Phileas Fogg, who was set down in the betting books as if he were a race-horse.

388
00:42:35,880 --> 00:42:45,280
Bonds were issued, and made their appearance on 'Change; "Phileas Fogg bonds" were offered at par or at a premium, and a great business was done in them.

389
00:42:46,099 --> 00:42:55,420
But five days after the article in the bulletin of the Geographical Society appeared, the demand began to subside:  "Phileas Fogg" declined.

390
00:42:56,039 --> 00:43:04,160
They were offered by packages, at first of five, then of ten, until at last nobody would take less than twenty, fifty, a hundred!

391
00:43:05,140 --> 00:43:11,980
Lord Albemarle, an elderly paralytic gentleman, was now the only advocate of Phileas Fogg left.

392
00:43:12,700 --> 00:43:22,579
This noble lord, who was fastened to his chair, would have given his fortune to be able to make the tour of the world, if it took ten years; and he bet five thousand pounds on Phileas Fogg.

393
00:43:23,320 --> 00:43:34,920
When the folly as well as the uselessness of the adventure was pointed out to him, he contented himself with replying, "If the thing is feasible, the first to do it ought to be an Englishman."

394
00:43:35,940 --> 00:43:50,900
The Fogg party dwindled more and more, everybody was going against him, and the bets stood a hundred and fifty and two hundred to one; and a week after his departure an incident occurred which deprived him of backers at any price.

395
00:43:51,440 --> 00:43:58,579
The commissioner of police was sitting in his office at nine o'clock one evening, when the following telegraphic dispatch was put into his hands:

396
00:43:59,280 --> 00:44:00,359
Suez to London.

397
00:44:00,960 --> 00:44:03,480
Rowan, Commissioner of Police, Scotland Yard:

398
00:44:04,200 --> 00:44:06,720
I've found the bank robber, Phileas Fogg.

399
00:44:07,260 --> 00:44:10,200
Send with out delay warrant of arrest to Bombay.

400
00:44:10,940 --> 00:44:13,480
Fix, Detective.

401
00:44:13,580 --> 00:44:16,240
The effect of this dispatch was instantaneous.

402
00:44:16,579 --> 00:44:19,980
The polished gentleman disappeared to give place to the bank robber.

403
00:44:20,460 --> 00:44:32,339
His photograph, which was hung with those of the rest of the members at the Reform Club, was minutely examined, and it betrayed, feature by feature, the description of the robber which had been provided to the police.

404
00:44:32,920 --> 00:44:49,940
The mysterious habits of Phileas Fogg were recalled; his solitary ways, his sudden departure; and it seemed clear that, in undertaking a tour round the world on the pretext of a wager, he had had no other end in view than to elude the detectives, and throw them off his track.

Chapter 6

411
00:45:13,950 --> 00:45:19,089
IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, BETRAYS A VERY NATURAL IMPATIENCE

412
00:45:19,840 --> 00:45:25,460
The circumstances under which this telegraphic dispatch about Phileas Fogg was sent were as follows:

413
00:45:26,020 --> 00:45:40,860
The steamer Mongolia, belonging to the Peninsular and Oriental Company, built of iron, of two thousand eight hundred tons burden, and five hundred horse-power, was due at eleven o'clock a.m. on Wednesday, the 9th of October, at Suez.

414
00:45:40,940 --> 00:45:59,060
The Mongolia plied regularly between Brindisi and Bombay via the Suez Canal, and was one of the fastest steamers belonging to the company, always making more than ten knots an hour between Brindisi and Suez, and nine and a half between Suez and Bombay.

415
00:46:00,240 --> 00:46:10,040
Two men were promenading up and down the wharves, among the crowd of natives and strangers who were sojourning at this once straggling village--now, thanks to the enterprise of M.

416
00:46:10,060 --> 00:46:12,039
Lesseps, a fast-growing town.

417
00:46:12,720 --> 00:46:34,940
One was the British consul at Suez, who, despite the prophecies of the English Government, and the unfavourable predictions of Stephenson, was in the habit of seeing, from his office window, English ships daily passing to and fro on the great canal, by which the old roundabout route from England to India by the Cape of Good Hope was abridged by at least a half.

418
00:46:35,540 --> 00:46:44,900
The other was a small, slight-built personage, with a nervous, intelligent face, and bright eyes peering out from under eyebrows which he was incessantly twitching.

419
00:46:45,420 --> 00:46:53,859
He was just now manifesting unmistakable signs of impatience, nervously pacing up and down, and unable to stand still for a moment.

420
00:46:54,640 --> 00:47:15,660
This was Fix, one of the detectives who had been dispatched from England in search of the bank robber; it was his task to narrowly watch every passenger who arrived at Suez, and to follow up all who seemed to be suspicious characters, or bore a resemblance to the description of the criminal, which he had received two days before from the police headquarters at London.

421
00:47:16,560 --> 00:47:30,000
The detective was evidently inspired by the hope of obtaining the splendid reward which would be the prize of success, and awaited with a feverish impatience, easy to understand, the arrival of the steamer Mongolia.

422
00:47:30,579 --> 00:47:35,820
"So you say, consul," asked he for the twentieth time, "that this steamer is never behind time?"

423
00:47:36,780 --> 00:47:38,900
"No, Mr. Fix," replied the consul.

424
00:47:39,220 --> 00:47:45,020
"She was bespoken yesterday at Port Said, and the rest of the way is of no account to such a craft.

425
00:47:45,680 --> 00:47:54,840
I repeat that the Mongolia has been in advance of the time required by the company's regulations, and gained the prize awarded for excess of speed."

426
00:47:55,380 --> 00:47:57,460
"Does she come directly from Brindisi?"

427
00:47:58,040 --> 00:48:04,579
"Directly from Brindisi; she takes on the Indian mails there, and she left there Saturday at five p.m.

428
00:48:05,280 --> 00:48:08,380
Have patience, Mr. Fix; she will not be late.

429
00:48:09,100 --> 00:48:16,620
But really, I don't see how, from the description you have, you will be able to recognise your man, even if he is on board the Mongolia."

430
00:48:17,100 --> 00:48:21,700
"A man rather feels the presence of these fellows, consul, than recognises them.

431
00:48:22,420 --> 00:48:29,200
You must have a scent for them, and a scent is like a sixth sense which combines hearing, seeing, and smelling.

432
00:48:29,220 --> 00:48:37,940
I've arrested more than one of these gentlemen in my time, and, if my thief is on board, I'll answer for it; he'll not slip through my fingers."

433
00:48:38,740 --> 00:48:41,859
"I hope so, Mr. Fix, for it was a heavy robbery."

434
00:48:42,620 --> 00:48:46,860
"A magnificent robbery, consul; fifty-five thousand pounds!

435
00:48:47,300 --> 00:48:49,180
We don't often have such windfalls.

436
00:48:49,640 --> 00:48:52,600
Burglars are getting to be so contemptible nowadays!

437
00:48:53,000 --> 00:48:55,580
A fellow gets hung for a handful of shillings!"

438
00:48:56,220 --> 00:49:04,400
"Mr. Fix," said the consul, "I like your way of talking, and hope you'll succeed; but I fear you will find it far from easy.

439
00:49:04,780 --> 00:49:10,480
Don't you see, the description which you have there has a singular resemblance to an honest man?"

440
00:49:11,140 --> 00:49:16,400
"Consul," remarked the detective, dogmatically, "great robbers always resemble honest folks.

441
00:49:17,480 --> 00:49:25,580
Fellows who have rascally faces have only one course to take, and that is to remain honest; otherwise they would be arrested off-hand.

442
00:49:26,320 --> 00:49:33,520
The artistic thing is, to unmask honest countenances; it's no light task, I admit, but a real art."

443
00:49:33,920 --> 00:49:38,160
Mr. Fix evidently was not wanting in a tinge of self-conceit.

444
00:49:38,300 --> 00:49:51,460
Little by little the scene on the quay became more animated; sailors of various nations, merchants, ship-brokers, porters, fellahs, bustled to and fro as if the steamer were immediately expected.

445
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:54,240
The weather was clear, and slightly chilly.

446
00:49:54,840 --> 00:49:59,260
The minarets of the town loomed above the houses in the pale rays of the sun.

447
00:50:00,060 --> 00:50:04,839
A jetty pier, some two thousand yards along, extended into the roadstead.

448
00:50:05,640 --> 00:50:13,820
A number of fishing-smacks and coasting boats, some retaining the fantastic fashion of ancient galleys, were discernible on the Red Sea.

449
00:50:14,599 --> 00:50:21,640
As he passed among the busy crowd, Fix, according to habit, scrutinised the passers-by with a keen, rapid glance.

450
00:50:22,160 --> 00:50:23,859
It was now half-past ten.

451
00:50:24,420 --> 00:50:25,840
"The steamer doesn't come!"

452
00:50:26,119 --> 00:50:28,140
he exclaimed, as the port clock struck.

453
00:50:28,720 --> 00:50:31,520
"She can't be far off now," returned his companion.

454
00:50:32,080 --> 00:50:34,080
"How long will she stop at Suez?"

455
00:50:34,520 --> 00:50:37,060
"Four hours; long enough to get in her coal.

456
00:50:37,660 --> 00:50:45,100
It is thirteen hundred and ten miles from Suez to Aden, at the other end of the Red Sea, and she has to take in a fresh coal supply."

457
00:50:45,260 --> 00:50:49,000
"And does she go from Suez directly to Bombay?"

458
00:50:49,680 --> 00:50:51,279
"Without putting in anywhere."

459
00:50:51,780 --> 00:50:52,239
"Good!"

460
00:50:52,359 --> 00:50:53,040
said Fix.

461
00:50:53,339 --> 00:51:00,600
"If the robber is on board he will no doubt get off at Suez, so as to reach the Dutch or French colonies in Asia by some other route.

462
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,860
He ought to know that he would not be safe an hour in India, which is English soil."

463
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,220
"Unless," objected the consul, "he is exceptionally shrewd.

464
00:51:10,880 --> 00:51:16,140
An English criminal, you know, is always better concealed in London than anywhere else."

465
00:51:16,780 --> 00:51:23,099
This observation furnished the detective food for thought, and meanwhile the consul went away to his office.

466
00:51:23,720 --> 00:51:30,200
Fix, left alone, was more impatient than ever, having a presentiment that the robber was on board the Mongolia.

467
00:51:30,959 --> 00:51:40,460
If he had indeed left London intending to reach the New World, he would naturally take the route via India, which was less watched and more difficult to watch than that of the Atlantic.

468
00:51:41,300 --> 00:51:48,200
But Fix's reflections were soon interrupted by a succession of sharp whistles, which announced the arrival of the Mongolia.

469
00:51:48,940 --> 00:51:55,040
The porters and fellahs rushed down the quay, and a dozen boats pushed off from the shore to go and meet the steamer.

470
00:51:55,440 --> 00:52:02,360
Soon her gigantic hull appeared passing along between the banks, and eleven o'clock struck as she anchored in the road.

471
00:52:03,220 --> 00:52:14,180
She brought an unusual number of passengers, some of whom remained on deck to scan the picturesque panorama of the town, while the greater part disembarked in the boats, and landed on the quay.

472
00:52:15,099 --> 00:52:20,780
Fix took up a position, and carefully examined each face and figure which made its appearance.

473
00:52:21,420 --> 00:52:36,039
Presently one of the passengers, after vigorously pushing his way through the importunate crowd of porters, came up to him and politely asked if he could point out the English consulate, at the same time showing a passport which he wished to have visaed.

474
00:52:36,660 --> 00:52:42,280
Fix instinctively took the passport, and with a rapid glance read the description of its bearer.

475
00:52:43,000 --> 00:52:52,539
An involuntary motion of surprise nearly escaped him, for the description in the passport was identical with that of the bank robber which he had received from Scotland Yard.

476
00:52:53,120 --> 00:52:54,299
"Is this your passport?"

477
00:52:54,520 --> 00:52:54,960
asked he.

478
00:52:55,500 --> 00:52:56,960
"No, it's my master's."

479
00:52:57,440 --> 00:52:58,460
"And your master is--"

480
00:52:58,740 --> 00:52:59,640
"He stayed on board."

481
00:53:00,520 --> 00:53:04,560
"But he must go to the consul's in person, so as to establish his identity."

482
00:53:05,080 --> 00:53:06,579
"Oh, is that necessary?"

483
00:53:07,120 --> 00:53:08,380
"Quite indispensable."

484
00:53:09,000 --> 00:53:10,720
"And where is the consulate?"

485
00:53:11,119 --> 00:53:15,960
"There, on the corner of the square," said Fix, pointing to a house two hundred steps off.

486
00:53:16,420 --> 00:53:21,039
"I'll go and fetch my master, who won't be much pleased, however, to be disturbed."

487
00:53:21,140 --> 00:53:25,839
The passenger bowed to Fix, and returned to the steamer.

Chapter 7

494
00:53:49,109 --> 00:53:55,420
WHICH ONCE MORE DEMONSTRATES THE USELESSNESS OF PASSPORTS AS AIDS TO DETECTIVES

495
00:53:56,160 --> 00:54:03,540
The detective passed down the quay, and rapidly made his way to the consul's office, where he was at once admitted to the presence of that official.

496
00:54:04,180 --> 00:54:11,200
"Consul," said he, without preamble, "I have strong reasons for believing that my man is a passenger on the Mongolia."

497
00:54:11,859 --> 00:54:14,940
And he narrated what had just passed concerning the passport.

498
00:54:16,000 --> 00:54:26,160
"Well, Mr. Fix," replied the consul, "I shall not be sorry to see the rascal's face; but perhaps he won't come here--that is, if he is the person you suppose him to be.

499
00:54:26,900 --> 00:54:35,739
A robber doesn't quite like to leave traces of his flight behind him; and, besides, he is not obliged to have his passport countersigned."

500
00:54:35,760 --> 00:54:39,060
"If he is as shrewd as I think he is, consul, he will come."

501
00:54:39,820 --> 00:54:41,200
"To have his passport visaed?"

502
00:54:41,920 --> 00:54:42,299
"Yes.

503
00:54:42,540 --> 00:54:48,240
Passports are only good for annoying honest folks, and aiding in the flight of rogues.

504
00:54:48,400 --> 00:54:53,819
I assure you it will be quite the thing for him to do; but I hope you will not visa the passport."

505
00:54:54,760 --> 00:54:55,400
"Why not?

506
00:54:55,920 --> 00:54:59,099
If the passport is genuine I have no right to refuse."

507
00:54:59,520 --> 00:55:04,140
"Still, I must keep this man here until I can get a warrant to arrest him from London."

508
00:55:04,680 --> 00:55:06,060
"Ah, that's your look-out.

509
00:55:06,319 --> 00:55:07,240
But I cannot--"

510
00:55:07,660 --> 00:55:17,319
The consul did not finish his sentence, for as he spoke a knock was heard at the door, and two strangers entered, one of whom was the servant whom Fix had met on the quay.

511
00:55:17,940 --> 00:55:24,620
The other, who was his master, held out his passport with the request that the consul would do him the favour to visa it.

512
00:55:24,720 --> 00:55:33,040
The consul took the document and carefully read it, whilst Fix observed, or rather devoured, the stranger with his eyes from a corner of the room.

513
00:55:33,900 --> 00:55:35,780
"You are Mr. Phileas Fogg?"

514
00:55:35,940 --> 00:55:37,920
said the consul, after reading the passport.

515
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:39,099
"I am."

516
00:55:39,680 --> 00:55:41,260
"And this man is your servant?"

517
00:55:41,740 --> 00:55:44,180
"He is: a Frenchman, named Passepartout."

518
00:55:44,960 --> 00:55:45,819
"You are from London?"

519
00:55:46,319 --> 00:55:46,900
"Yes."

520
00:55:47,320 --> 00:55:48,100
"And you are going--"

521
00:55:48,440 --> 00:55:49,060
"To Bombay."

522
00:55:49,799 --> 00:55:50,560
"Very good, sir.

523
00:55:51,180 --> 00:55:54,940
You know that a visa is useless, and that no passport is required?"

524
00:55:55,599 --> 00:56:01,880
"I know it, sir," replied Phileas Fogg; "but I wish to prove, by your visa, that I came by Suez."

525
00:56:02,660 --> 00:56:03,440
"Very well, sir."

526
00:56:04,100 --> 00:56:09,260
The consul proceeded to sign and date the passport, after which he added his official seal.

527
00:56:09,860 --> 00:56:15,180
Mr. Fogg paid the customary fee, coldly bowed, and went out, followed by his servant.

528
00:56:15,720 --> 00:56:16,120
"Well?"

529
00:56:16,400 --> 00:56:17,260
queried the detective.

530
00:56:17,920 --> 00:56:21,819
"Well, he looks and acts like a perfectly honest man," replied the consul.

531
00:56:22,460 --> 00:56:24,680
"Possibly; but that is not the question.

532
00:56:25,100 --> 00:56:32,400
Do you think, consul, that this phlegmatic gentleman resembles, feature by feature, the robber whose description I have received?"

533
00:56:32,900 --> 00:56:36,580
"I concede that; but then, you know, all descriptions--"

534
00:56:36,820 --> 00:56:39,340
"I'll make certain of it," interrupted Fix.

535
00:56:39,780 --> 00:56:46,420
"The servant seems to me less mysterious than the master; besides, he's a Frenchman, and can't help talking.

536
00:56:46,440 --> 00:56:48,320
Excuse me for a little while, consul."

537
00:56:48,960 --> 00:56:51,360
Fix started off in search of Passepartout.

538
00:56:52,420 --> 00:57:02,820
Meanwhile Mr. Fogg, after leaving the consulate, repaired to the quay, gave some orders to Passepartout, went off to the    Mongolia in a boat, and descended to his cabin.

539
00:57:02,840 --> 00:57:06,260
He took up his note-book, which contained the following memoranda:

540
00:57:07,140 --> 00:57:11,180
"Left London, Wednesday, October 2nd, at 8.45 p.m.

541
00:57:11,780 --> 00:57:15,240
"Reached Paris, Thursday, October 3rd, at 7.20 a.m.

542
00:57:15,980 --> 00:57:18,680
"Left Paris, Thursday, at 8.40 a.m.

543
00:57:19,259 --> 00:57:24,780
"Reached Turin by Mont Cenis, Friday, October 4th, at 6.35 a.m.

544
00:57:25,580 --> 00:57:27,859
"Left Turin, Friday, at 7.20 a.m.

545
00:57:28,520 --> 00:57:32,740
"Arrived at Brindisi, Saturday, October 5th, at 4 p.m.

546
00:57:33,400 --> 00:57:36,440
"Sailed on the Mongolia, Saturday, at 5 p.m.

547
00:57:36,940 --> 00:57:40,580
"Reached Suez, Wednesday, October 9th, at 11 a.m.

548
00:57:41,220 --> 00:57:47,400
"Total of hours spent, 158+; or, in days, six days and a half."

549
00:57:48,080 --> 00:58:17,920
These dates were inscribed in an itinerary divided into columns, indicating the month, the day of the month, and the day for the stipulated and actual arrivals at each principal point Paris, Brindisi, Suez, Bombay, Calcutta, Singapore, Hong Kong, Yokohama, San Francisco, New York, and London--from the 2nd of October to the 21st of December; and giving a space for setting down the gain made or the loss suffered on arrival at each locality.

550
00:58:18,720 --> 00:58:29,040
This methodical record thus contained an account of everything needed, and Mr. Fogg always knew whether he was behind-hand or in advance of his time.

551
00:58:29,080 --> 00:58:36,559
On this Friday, October 9th, he noted his arrival at Suez, and observed that he had as yet neither gained nor lost.

552
00:58:37,060 --> 00:58:48,200
He sat down quietly to breakfast in his cabin, never once thinking of inspecting the town, being one of those Englishmen who are wont to see foreign countries through the eyes of their domestics.

IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TALKS RATHER MORE, PERHAPS, THAN IS PRUDENT

560
00:59:18,299 --> 00:59:27,079
Fix soon rejoined Passepartout, who was lounging and looking about on the quay, as if he did not feel that he, at least, was obliged not to see anything.

561
00:59:27,759 --> 00:59:32,260
"Well, my friend," said the detective, coming up with him, "is your passport visaed?"

562
00:59:32,900 --> 00:59:34,700
"Ah, it's you, is it, monsieur?"

responded Passepartout.

564
00:59:36,820 --> 00:59:39,279
"Thanks, yes, the passport is all right."

565
00:59:39,920 --> 00:59:41,199
"And you are looking about you?"

566
00:59:41,780 --> 00:59:45,319
"Yes; but we travel so fast that I seem to be journeying in a dream.

567
00:59:45,819 --> 00:59:47,460
So this is Suez?"

568
00:59:47,960 --> 00:59:48,539
"Yes."

569
00:59:48,940 --> 00:59:49,519
"In Egypt?"

570
00:59:49,920 --> 00:59:51,160
"Certainly, in Egypt."

571
00:59:51,700 --> 00:59:52,500
"And in Africa?"

572
00:59:53,019 --> 00:59:53,720
"In Africa."

573
00:59:54,680 --> 00:59:55,660
"In Africa!"

574
00:59:55,880 --> 00:59:56,960
repeated Passepartout.

575
00:59:57,600 --> 01:00:13,660
"Just think, monsieur, I had no idea that we should go farther than Paris; and all that I saw of Paris was between twenty minutes past seven and twenty minutes before nine in the morning, between the Northern and the Lyons stations, through the windows of a car, and in a driving rain!

576
01:00:14,160 --> 01:00:20,280
How I regret not having seen once more Pere la Chaise and the circus in the Champs Elysees!"

577
01:00:20,859 --> 01:00:22,320
"You are in a great hurry, then?"

578
01:00:23,119 --> 01:00:25,060
"I am not, but my master is.

579
01:00:25,619 --> 01:00:28,120
By the way, I must buy some shoes and shirts.

580
01:00:28,480 --> 01:00:32,020
We came away without trunks, only with a carpet-bag."

581
01:00:32,180 --> 01:00:35,380
"I will show you an excellent shop for getting what you want."

582
01:00:35,840 --> 01:00:38,579
"Really, monsieur, you are very kind."

583
01:00:38,660 --> 01:00:42,840
And they walked off together, Passepartout chatting volubly as they went along.

584
01:00:43,180 --> 01:00:46,180
"Above all," said he; "don't let me lose the steamer."

585
01:00:46,980 --> 01:00:49,400
"You have plenty of time; it's only twelve o'clock."

586
01:00:50,299 --> 01:00:52,239
Passepartout pulled out his big watch.

587
01:00:52,740 --> 01:00:53,140
"Twelve!"

588
01:00:53,519 --> 01:00:56,560
he exclaimed; "why, it's only eight minutes before ten."

589
01:00:57,240 --> 01:00:58,440
"Your watch is slow."

590
01:00:59,220 --> 01:00:59,800
"My watch?

591
01:01:00,039 --> 01:01:03,720
A family watch, monsieur, which has come down from my great-grandfather!

592
01:01:04,120 --> 01:01:06,299
It doesn't vary five minutes in the year.

593
01:01:06,779 --> 01:01:08,740
It's a perfect chronometer, look you."

594
01:01:09,519 --> 01:01:11,720
"I see how it is," said Fix.

595
01:01:11,980 --> 01:01:15,859
"You have kept London time, which is two hours behind that of Suez.

596
01:01:16,380 --> 01:01:19,160
You ought to regulate your watch at noon in each country."

597
01:01:19,700 --> 01:01:21,300
"I regulate my watch?

598
01:01:21,619 --> 01:01:22,060
Never!"

599
01:01:22,860 --> 01:01:24,940
"Well, then, it will not agree with the sun."

600
01:01:25,519 --> 01:01:27,400
"So much the worse for the sun, monsieur.

601
01:01:27,800 --> 01:01:29,380
The sun will be wrong, then!"

602
01:01:29,960 --> 01:01:33,600
And the worthy fellow returned the watch to its fob with a defiant gesture.

603
01:01:34,180 --> 01:01:38,860
After a few minutes silence, Fix resumed: "You left London hastily, then?"

604
01:01:39,440 --> 01:01:40,640
"I rather think so!

605
01:01:41,019 --> 01:01:48,239
Last Friday at eight o'clock in the evening, Monsieur Fogg came home from his club, and three-quarters of an hour afterwards we were off."

606
01:01:48,859 --> 01:01:50,500
"But where is your master going?"

607
01:01:51,259 --> 01:01:52,539
"Always straight ahead.

608
01:01:52,620 --> 01:01:54,060
He is going round the world."

609
01:01:54,680 --> 01:01:55,780
"Round the world?"

610
01:01:55,960 --> 01:01:56,760
cried Fix.

611
01:01:57,339 --> 01:01:59,140
"Yes, and in eighty days!

612
01:01:59,439 --> 01:02:03,420
He says it is on a wager; but, between us, I don't believe a word of it.

613
01:02:03,840 --> 01:02:05,339
That wouldn't be common sense.

614
01:02:05,600 --> 01:02:07,340
There's something else in the wind."

615
01:02:07,880 --> 01:02:08,280
"Ah!

616
01:02:08,440 --> 01:02:10,280
Mr. Fogg is a character, is he?"

617
01:02:10,900 --> 01:02:12,440
"I should say he was."

618
01:02:12,940 --> 01:02:13,680
"Is he rich?"

619
01:02:14,299 --> 01:02:19,160
"No doubt, for he is carrying an enormous sum in brand new banknotes with him.

620
01:02:19,180 --> 01:02:28,200
And he doesn't spare the money on the way, either: he has offered a large reward to the engineer of the Mongolia if he gets us to Bombay well in advance of time."

621
01:02:28,940 --> 01:02:31,040
"And you have known your master a long time?"

622
01:02:31,660 --> 01:02:35,259
"Why, no; I entered his service the very day we left London."

623
01:02:36,000 --> 01:02:41,860
The effect of these replies upon the already suspicious and excited detective may be imagined.

624
01:02:42,400 --> 01:02:56,600
The hasty departure from London soon after the robbery; the large sum carried by Mr. Fogg; his eagerness to reach distant countries; the pretext of an eccentric and foolhardy bet--all confirmed Fix in his theory.

625
01:02:57,300 --> 01:03:13,000
He continued to pump poor Passepartout, and learned that he really knew little or nothing of his master, who lived a solitary existence in London, was said to be rich, though no one knew whence came his riches, and was mysterious and impenetrable in his affairs and habits.

626
01:03:13,420 --> 01:03:19,280
Fix felt sure that Phileas Fogg would not land at Suez, but was really going on to Bombay.

627
01:03:19,940 --> 01:03:21,880
"Is Bombay far from here?"

628
01:03:21,900 --> 01:03:22,920
asked Passepartout.

629
01:03:23,520 --> 01:03:24,420
"Pretty far.

630
01:03:24,440 --> 01:03:26,460
It is a ten days' voyage by sea."

631
01:03:26,880 --> 01:03:28,660
"And in what country is Bombay?"

632
01:03:29,080 --> 01:03:29,540
"India."

633
01:03:29,920 --> 01:03:30,420
"In Asia?"

634
01:03:30,820 --> 01:03:31,500
"Certainly."

635
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:32,760
"The deuce!

636
01:03:32,900 --> 01:03:36,480
I was going to tell you there's one thing that worries me--my burner!"

637
01:03:36,839 --> 01:03:37,460
"What burner?"

638
01:03:37,840 --> 01:03:43,559
"My gas-burner, which I forgot to turn off, and which is at this moment burning at my expense.

639
01:03:43,900 --> 01:03:54,180
I have calculated, monsieur, that I lose two shillings every four and twenty hours, exactly sixpence more than I earn; and you will understand that the longer our journey--"

640
01:03:54,440 --> 01:03:58,340
Did Fix pay any attention to Passepartout's trouble about the gas?

641
01:03:58,420 --> 01:03:59,380
It is not probable.

642
01:03:59,559 --> 01:04:02,460
He was not listening, but was cogitating a project.

643
01:04:02,860 --> 01:04:13,180
Passepartout and he had now reached the shop, where Fix left his companion to make his purchases, after recommending him not to miss the steamer, and hurried back to the consulate.

644
01:04:13,460 --> 01:04:17,480
Now that he was fully convinced, Fix had quite recovered his equanimity.

645
01:04:18,060 --> 01:04:21,260
"Consul," said he, "I have no longer any doubt.

646
01:04:21,280 --> 01:04:22,560
I have spotted my man.

647
01:04:22,940 --> 01:04:28,059
He passes himself off as an odd stick who is going round the world in eighty days."

648
01:04:28,640 --> 01:04:35,940
"Then he's a sharp fellow," returned the consul, "and counts on returning to London after putting the police of the two countries off his track."

649
01:04:36,420 --> 01:04:38,619
"We'll see about that," replied Fix.

650
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,539
"But are you not mistaken?"

651
01:04:40,880 --> 01:04:42,299
"I am not mistaken."

652
01:04:42,660 --> 01:04:47,559
"Why was this robber so anxious to prove, by the visa, that he had passed through Suez?"

653
01:04:48,339 --> 01:04:48,859
"Why?

654
01:04:48,940 --> 01:04:51,259
I have no idea; but listen to me."

655
01:04:52,080 --> 01:04:56,740
He reported in a few words the most important parts of his conversation with Passepartout.

656
01:04:57,460 --> 01:05:01,300
"In short," said the consul, "appearances are wholly against this man.

657
01:05:01,880 --> 01:05:03,140
And what are you going to do?"

658
01:05:03,940 --> 01:05:19,600
"Send a dispatch to London for a warrant of arrest to be dispatched instantly to Bombay, take passage on board the Mongolia, follow my rogue to India, and there, on English ground, arrest him politely, with my warrant in my hand, and my hand on his shoulder."

659
01:05:20,480 --> 01:05:32,140
Having uttered these words with a cool, careless air, the detective took leave of the consul, and repaired to the telegraph office, whence he sent the dispatch which we have seen to the London police office.

660
01:05:32,720 --> 01:05:45,339
A quarter of an hour later found Fix, with a small bag in his hand, proceeding on board the Mongolia; and, ere many moments longer, the noble steamer rode out at full steam upon the waters of the Red Sea.

Around the World in Eighty Days
by
Jules Verne

665
01:06:04,870 --> 01:06:08,020
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

666
01:06:08,020 --> 01:06:09,570
Chapter 9

667
01:06:09,570 --> 01:06:16,160
IN WHICH THE RED SEA AND THE INDIAN OCEAN PROVE PROPITIOUS TO THE DESIGNS OF PHILEAS FOGG

668
01:06:16,880 --> 01:06:28,000
The distance between Suez and Aden is precisely thirteen hundred and ten miles, and the regulations of the company allow the steamers one hundred and thirty-eight hours in which to traverse it.

669
01:06:28,539 --> 01:06:37,960
The Mongolia, thanks to the vigorous exertions of the engineer, seemed likely, so rapid was her speed, to reach her destination considerably within that time.

670
01:06:38,960 --> 01:06:51,279
The greater part of the passengers from Brindisi were bound for India some for Bombay, others for Calcutta by way of Bombay, the nearest route thither, now that a railway crosses the Indian peninsula.

671
01:06:51,900 --> 01:07:17,060
Among the passengers was a number of officials and military officers of various grades, the latter being either attached to the regular British forces or commanding the Sepoy troops, and receiving high salaries ever since the central government has assumed the powers of the East India Company: for the sub-lieutenants get 280 pounds, brigadiers, 2,400 pounds, and generals of divisions, 4,000 pounds.

672
01:07:17,760 --> 01:07:26,720
What with the military men, a number of rich young Englishmen on their travels, and the hospitable efforts of the purser, the time passed quickly on the Mongolia.

673
01:07:27,180 --> 01:07:42,260
The best of fare was spread upon the cabin tables at breakfast, lunch, dinner, and the eight o'clock supper, and the ladies scrupulously changed their toilets twice a day; and the hours were whirled away, when the sea was tranquil, with music, dancing, and games.

674
01:07:43,000 --> 01:07:48,680
But the Red Sea is full of caprice, and often boisterous, like most long and narrow gulfs.

675
01:07:49,140 --> 01:07:55,020
When the wind came from the African or Asian coast the Mongolia, with her long hull, rolled fearfully.

676
01:07:55,720 --> 01:08:02,380
Then the ladies speedily disappeared below; the pianos were silent; singing and dancing suddenly ceased.

677
01:08:02,800 --> 01:08:09,480
Yet the good ship ploughed straight on, unretarded by wind or wave, towards the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb.

678
01:08:10,180 --> 01:08:12,559
What was Phileas Fogg doing all this time?

679
01:08:13,040 --> 01:08:27,660
It might be thought that, in his anxiety, he would be constantly watching the changes of the wind, the disorderly raging of the billows--every chance, in short, which might force the Mongolia to slacken her speed, and thus interrupt his journey.

680
01:08:28,340 --> 01:08:33,580
But, if he thought of these possibilities, he did not betray the fact by any outward sign.

681
01:08:34,340 --> 01:09:13,120
Always the same impassible member of the Reform Club, whom no incident could surprise, as unvarying as the ship's chronometers, and seldom having the curiosity even to go upon the deck, he passed through the memorable scenes of the Red Sea with cold indifference; did not care to recognise the historic towns and villages which, along its borders, raised their picturesque outlines against the sky; and betrayed no fear of the dangers of the Arabic Gulf, which the old historians always spoke of with horror, and upon which the ancient navigators never ventured without propitiating the gods by ample sacrifices.

682
01:09:13,860 --> 01:09:17,560
How did this eccentric personage pass his time on the Mongolia?

683
01:09:18,240 --> 01:09:32,080
He made his four hearty meals every day, regardless of the most persistent rolling and pitching on the part of the steamer; and he played whist indefatigably, for he had found partners as enthusiastic in the game as himself.

684
01:09:32,100 --> 01:09:50,899
A tax-collector, on the way to his post at Goa; the Rev. Decimus Smith, returning to his parish at Bombay; and a brigadier-general of the English army, who was about to rejoin his brigade at Benares, made up the party, and, with Mr. Fogg, played whist by the hour together in absorbing silence.

685
01:09:51,979 --> 01:09:59,020
As for Passepartout, he, too, had escaped sea-sickness, and took his meals conscientiously in the forward cabin.

686
01:09:59,180 --> 01:10:11,739
He rather enjoyed the voyage, for he was well fed and well lodged, took a great interest in the scenes through which they were passing, and consoled himself with the delusion that his master's whim would end at Bombay.

687
01:10:12,400 --> 01:10:19,880
He was pleased, on the day after leaving Suez, to find on deck the obliging person with whom he had walked and chatted on the quays.

688
01:10:20,660 --> 01:10:30,139
"If I am not mistaken," said he, approaching this person, with his most amiable smile, "you are the gentleman who so kindly volunteered to guide me at Suez?"

689
01:10:31,140 --> 01:10:31,620
"Ah!

690
01:10:31,640 --> 01:10:32,860
I quite recognise you.

691
01:10:33,179 --> 01:10:35,320
You are the servant of the strange Englishman--"

692
01:10:35,900 --> 01:10:36,980
"Just so, monsieur--"

693
01:10:37,600 --> 01:10:38,180
"Fix."

694
01:10:38,660 --> 01:10:43,140
"Monsieur Fix," resumed Passepartout, "I'm charmed to find you on board.

695
01:10:43,560 --> 01:10:44,679
Where are you bound?"

696
01:10:45,380 --> 01:10:46,720
"Like you, to Bombay."

697
01:10:47,640 --> 01:10:48,560
"That's capital!

698
01:10:48,940 --> 01:10:50,300
Have you made this trip before?"

699
01:10:50,940 --> 01:10:52,160
"Several times.

700
01:10:52,180 --> 01:10:54,860
I am one of the agents of the Peninsular Company."

701
01:10:55,620 --> 01:10:57,000
"Then you know India?"

702
01:10:57,780 --> 01:11:00,840
"Why yes," replied Fix, who spoke cautiously.

703
01:11:01,720 --> 01:11:03,420
"A curious place, this India?"

704
01:11:04,460 --> 01:11:05,860
"Oh, very curious.

705
01:11:06,260 --> 01:11:12,120
Mosques, minarets, temples, fakirs, pagodas, tigers, snakes, elephants!

706
01:11:12,480 --> 01:11:15,040
I hope you will have ample time to see the sights."

707
01:11:15,780 --> 01:11:17,400
"I hope so, Monsieur Fix.

708
01:11:17,840 --> 01:11:30,860
You see, a man of sound sense ought not to spend his life jumping from a steamer upon a railway train, and from a railway train upon a steamer again, pretending to make the tour of the world in eighty days!

709
01:11:30,880 --> 01:11:35,219
No; all these gymnastics, you may be sure, will cease at Bombay."

710
01:11:36,240 --> 01:11:39,000
"And Mr. Fogg is getting on well?"

711
01:11:39,020 --> 01:11:41,440
asked Fix, in the most natural tone in the world.

712
01:11:42,120 --> 01:11:44,260
"Quite well, and I too.

713
01:11:44,280 --> 01:11:47,360
I eat like a famished ogre; it's the sea air."

714
01:11:48,239 --> 01:11:50,260
"But I never see your master on deck."

715
01:11:50,800 --> 01:11:53,240
"Never; he hasn't the least curiosity."

716
01:11:54,080 --> 01:12:02,860
"Do you know, Mr. Passepartout, that this pretended tour in eighty days may conceal some secret errand--perhaps a diplomatic mission?"

717
01:12:03,780 --> 01:12:09,840
"Faith, Monsieur Fix, I assure you I know nothing about it, nor would I give half a crown to find out."

718
01:12:10,960 --> 01:12:19,400
After this meeting, Passepartout and Fix got into the habit of chatting together, the latter making it a point to gain the worthy man's confidence.

719
01:12:19,820 --> 01:12:32,560
He frequently offered him a glass of whiskey or pale ale in the steamer bar-room, which Passepartout never failed to accept with graceful alacrity, mentally pronouncing Fix the best of good fellows.

720
01:12:33,600 --> 01:12:47,380
Meanwhile the Mongolia was pushing forward rapidly; on the 13th, Mocha, surrounded by its ruined walls whereon date-trees were growing, was sighted, and on the mountains beyond were espied vast coffee-fields.

721
01:12:47,780 --> 01:12:57,480
Passepartout was ravished to behold this celebrated place, and thought that, with its circular walls and dismantled fort, it looked like an immense coffee-cup and saucer.

722
01:12:58,400 --> 01:13:11,040
The following night they passed through the Strait of Bab-el-Mandeb, which means in Arabic The Bridge of Tears, and the next day they put in at Steamer Point, north-west of Aden harbour, to take in coal.

723
01:13:11,600 --> 01:13:21,300
This matter of fuelling steamers is a serious one at such distances from the coal-mines; it costs the Peninsular Company some eight hundred thousand pounds a year.

724
01:13:22,160 --> 01:13:27,040
In these distant seas, coal is worth three or four pounds sterling a ton.

725
01:13:27,860 --> 01:13:38,240
The Mongolia had still sixteen hundred and fifty miles to traverse before reaching Bombay, and was obliged to remain four hours at Steamer Point to coal up.

726
01:13:38,360 --> 01:13:53,120
But this delay, as it was foreseen, did not affect Phileas Fogg's programme; besides, the Mongolia, instead of reaching Aden on the morning of the 15th, when she was due, arrived there on the evening of the 14th, a gain of fifteen hours.

727
01:13:54,060 --> 01:14:00,660
Mr. Fogg and his servant went ashore at Aden to have the passport again visaed; Fix, unobserved, followed them.

728
01:14:01,260 --> 01:14:18,260
The visa procured, Mr. Fogg returned on board to resume his former habits; while Passepartout, according to custom, sauntered about among the mixed population of Somalis, Banyans, Parsees, Jews, Arabs, and Europeans who comprise the twenty-five thousand inhabitants of Aden.

729
01:14:18,880 --> 01:14:31,200
He gazed with wonder upon the fortifications which make this place the Gibraltar of the Indian Ocean, and the vast cisterns where the English engineers were still at work, two thousand years after the engineers of Solomon.

730
01:14:31,940 --> 01:14:36,860
"Very curious, very curious," said Passepartout to himself, on returning to the steamer.

731
01:14:37,420 --> 01:14:42,320
"I see that it is by no means useless to travel, if a man wants to see something new."

732
01:14:43,239 --> 01:14:48,940
At six p.m.  the Mongolia slowly moved out of the roadstead, and was soon once more on the Indian Ocean.

733
01:14:49,260 --> 01:14:58,500
She had a hundred and sixty-eight hours in which to reach Bombay, and the sea was favourable, the wind being in the north-west, and all sails aiding the engine.

734
01:14:59,260 --> 01:15:06,739
The steamer rolled but little, the ladies, in fresh toilets, reappeared on deck, and the singing and dancing were resumed.

735
01:15:06,840 --> 01:15:17,440
The trip was being accomplished most successfully, and Passepartout was enchanted with the congenial companion which chance had secured him in the person of the delightful Fix.

736
01:15:18,380 --> 01:15:26,220
On Sunday, October 20th, towards noon, they came in sight of the Indian coast: two hours later the pilot came on board.

737
01:15:26,240 --> 01:15:34,300
A range of hills lay against the sky in the horizon, and soon the rows of palms which adorn Bombay came distinctly into view.

738
01:15:35,200 --> 01:15:42,320
The steamer entered the road formed by the islands in the bay, and at half-past four she hauled up at the quays of Bombay.

739
01:15:43,460 --> 01:15:56,980
Phileas Fogg was in the act of finishing the thirty-third rubber of the voyage, and his partner and himself having, by a bold stroke, captured all thirteen of the tricks, concluded this fine campaign with a brilliant victory.

740
01:15:58,200 --> 01:16:03,160
The Mongolia was due at Bombay on the 22nd; she arrived on the 20th.

741
01:16:03,580 --> 01:16:13,580
This was a gain to Phileas Fogg of two days since his departure from London, and he calmly entered the fact in the itinerary, in the column of gains.

Chapter 10

748
01:16:37,559 --> 01:16:43,260
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT IS ONLY TOO GLAD TO GET OFF WITH THE LOSS OF HIS SHOES

749
01:16:43,900 --> 01:17:00,500
Everybody knows that the great reversed triangle of land, with its base in the north and its apex in the south, which is called India, embraces fourteen hundred thousand square miles, upon which is spread unequally a population of one hundred and eighty millions of souls.

750
01:17:01,400 --> 01:17:17,220
The British Crown exercises a real and despotic dominion over the larger portion of this vast country, and has a governor-general stationed at Calcutta, governors at Madras, Bombay, and in Bengal, and a lieutenant-governor at Agra.

751
01:17:18,220 --> 01:17:29,040
But British India, properly so called, only embraces seven hundred thousand square miles, and a population of from one hundred to one hundred and ten millions of inhabitants.

752
01:17:29,780 --> 01:17:38,520
A considerable portion of India is still free from British authority; and there are certain ferocious rajahs in the interior who are absolutely independent.

753
01:17:39,239 --> 01:17:52,340
The celebrated East India Company was all-powerful from 1756, when the English first gained a foothold on the spot where now stands the city of Madras, down to the time of the great Sepoy insurrection.

754
01:17:52,360 --> 01:18:03,420
It gradually annexed province after province, purchasing them of the native chiefs, whom it seldom paid, and appointed the governor-general and his subordinates, civil and military.

755
01:18:04,260 --> 01:18:11,719
But the East India Company has now passed away, leaving the British possessions in India directly under the control of the Crown.

756
01:18:12,260 --> 01:18:17,720
The aspect of the country, as well as the manners and distinctions of race, is daily changing.

757
01:18:18,639 --> 01:18:41,960
Formerly one was obliged to travel in India by the old cumbrous methods of going on foot or on horseback, in palanquins or unwieldy coaches; now fast steamboats ply on the Indus and the Ganges, and a great railway, with branch lines joining the main line at many points on its route, traverses the peninsula from Bombay to Calcutta in three days.

758
01:18:42,739 --> 01:18:46,360
This railway does not run in a direct line across India.

759
01:18:46,840 --> 01:18:58,380
The distance between Bombay and Calcutta, as the bird flies, is only from one thousand to eleven hundred miles; but the deflections of the road increase this distance by more than a third.

760
01:18:58,520 --> 01:19:36,860
The general route of the Great Indian Peninsula Railway is as follows: Leaving Bombay, it passes through Salcette, crossing to the continent opposite Tannah, goes over the chain of the Western Ghauts, runs thence north-east as far as Burhampoor, skirts the nearly independent territory of Bundelcund, ascends to Allahabad, turns thence eastwardly, meeting the Ganges at Benares, then departs from the river a little, and, descending south-eastward by Burdivan and the French town of Chandernagor, has its terminus at Calcutta.

761
01:19:37,720 --> 01:19:45,360
The passengers of the Mongolia went ashore at half-past four p.m.; at exactly eight the train would start for Calcutta.

762
01:19:46,180 --> 01:20:04,360
Mr. Fogg, after bidding good-bye to his whist partners, left the steamer, gave his servant several errands to do, urged it upon him to be at the station promptly at eight, and, with his regular step, which beat to the second, like an astronomical clock, directed his steps to the passport office.

763
01:20:04,980 --> 01:20:22,520
As for the wonders of Bombay--its famous city hall, its splendid library, its forts and docks, its bazaars, mosques, synagogues, its Armenian churches, and the noble pagoda on Malabar Hill, with its two polygonal towers--he cared not a straw to see them.

764
01:20:23,100 --> 01:20:37,040
He would not deign to examine even the masterpieces of Elephanta, or the mysterious hypogea, concealed south-east from the docks, or those fine remains of Buddhist architecture, the Kanherian grottoes of the island of Salcette.

765
01:20:37,900 --> 01:20:45,880
Having transacted his business at the passport office, Phileas Fogg repaired quietly to the railway station, where he ordered dinner.

766
01:20:46,619 --> 01:20:54,800
Among the dishes served up to him, the landlord especially recommended a certain giblet of "native rabbit," on which he prided himself.

767
01:20:55,260 --> 01:21:01,680
Mr. Fogg accordingly tasted the dish, but, despite its spiced sauce, found it far from palatable.

768
01:21:02,000 --> 01:21:08,300
He rang for the landlord, and, on his appearance, said, fixing his clear eyes upon him, "Is this rabbit, sir?"

769
01:21:08,960 --> 01:21:13,560
"Yes, my lord," the rogue boldly replied, "rabbit from the jungles."

770
01:21:14,160 --> 01:21:17,900
"And this rabbit did not mew when he was killed?"

771
01:21:17,960 --> 01:21:18,900
"Mew, my lord!

772
01:21:18,960 --> 01:21:20,740
What, a rabbit mew!

773
01:21:20,760 --> 01:21:21,620
I swear to you--"

774
01:21:22,180 --> 01:21:29,640
"Be so good, landlord, as not to swear, but remember this: cats were formerly considered, in India, as sacred animals.

775
01:21:30,060 --> 01:21:31,420
That was a good time."

776
01:21:32,160 --> 01:21:33,300
"For the cats, my lord?"

777
01:21:34,080 --> 01:21:35,980
"Perhaps for the travellers as well!"

778
01:21:37,120 --> 01:21:40,160
After which Mr. Fogg quietly continued his dinner.

779
01:21:40,900 --> 01:21:48,219
Fix had gone on shore shortly after Mr. Fogg, and his first destination was the headquarters of the Bombay police.

780
01:21:48,880 --> 01:22:01,640
He made himself known as a London detective, told his business at Bombay, and the position of affairs relative to the supposed robber, and nervously asked if a warrant had arrived from London.

781
01:22:01,659 --> 01:22:06,200
It had not reached the office; indeed, there had not yet been time for it to arrive.

782
01:22:06,700 --> 01:22:12,500
Fix was sorely disappointed, and tried to obtain an order of arrest from the director of the Bombay police.

783
01:22:13,199 --> 01:22:19,620
This the director refused, as the matter concerned the London office, which alone could legally deliver the warrant.

784
01:22:20,380 --> 01:22:32,440
Fix did not insist, and was fain to resign himself to await the arrival of the important document; but he was determined not to lose sight of the mysterious rogue as long as he stayed in Bombay.

785
01:22:32,719 --> 01:22:41,500
He did not doubt for a moment, any more than Passepartout, that Phileas Fogg would remain there, at least until it was time for the warrant to arrive.

786
01:22:42,600 --> 01:22:59,880
Passepartout, however, had no sooner heard his master's orders on leaving the Mongolia than he saw at once that they were to leave Bombay as they had done Suez and Paris, and that the journey would be extended at least as far as Calcutta, and perhaps beyond that place.

787
01:23:00,380 --> 01:23:13,560
He began to ask himself if this bet that Mr. Fogg talked about was not really in good earnest, and whether his fate was not in truth forcing him, despite his love of repose, around the world in eighty days!

788
01:23:14,639 --> 01:23:36,340
Having purchased the usual quota of shirts and shoes, he took a leisurely promenade about the streets, where crowds of people of many nationalities--Europeans, Persians with pointed caps, Banyas with round turbans, Sindes with square bonnets, Parsees with black mitres, and long-robed Armenians--were collected.

789
01:23:36,440 --> 01:23:38,920
It happened to be the day of a Parsee festival.

790
01:23:39,540 --> 01:24:10,180
These descendants of the sect of Zoroaster--the most thrifty, civilised, intelligent, and austere of the East Indians, among whom are counted the richest native merchants of Bombay--were celebrating a sort of religious carnival, with processions and shows, in the midst of which Indian dancing-girls, clothed in rose-coloured gauze, looped up with gold and silver, danced airily, but with perfect modesty, to the sound of viols and the clanging of tambourines.

791
01:24:10,220 --> 01:24:21,199
It is needless to say that Passepartout watched these curious ceremonies with staring eyes and gaping mouth, and that his countenance was that of the greenest booby imaginable.

792
01:24:21,760 --> 01:24:29,100
Unhappily for his master, as well as himself, his curiosity drew him unconsciously farther off than he intended to go.

793
01:24:29,860 --> 01:24:45,400
At last, having seen the Parsee carnival wind away in the distance, he was turning his steps towards the station, when he happened to espy the splendid pagoda on Malabar Hill, and was seized with an irresistible desire to see its interior.

794
01:24:46,120 --> 01:24:56,800
He was quite ignorant that it is forbidden to Christians to enter certain Indian temples, and that even the faithful must not go in without first leaving their shoes outside the door.

795
01:24:57,440 --> 01:25:05,820
It may be said here that the wise policy of the British Government severely punishes a disregard of the practices of the native religions.

796
01:25:06,240 --> 01:25:21,220
Passepartout, however, thinking no harm, went in like a simple tourist, and was soon lost in admiration of the splendid Brahmin ornamentation which everywhere met his eyes, when of a sudden he found himself sprawling on the sacred flagging.

797
01:25:21,760 --> 01:25:31,219
He looked up to behold three enraged priests, who forthwith fell upon him; tore off his shoes, and began to beat him with loud, savage exclamations.

798
01:25:31,680 --> 01:25:51,700
The agile Frenchman was soon upon his feet again, and lost no time in knocking down two of his long-gowned adversaries with his fists and a vigorous application of his toes; then, rushing out of the pagoda as fast as his legs could carry him, he soon escaped the third priest by mingling with the crowd in the streets.

799
01:25:52,780 --> 01:26:03,080
At five minutes before eight, Passepartout, hatless, shoeless, and having in the squabble lost his package of shirts and shoes, rushed breathlessly into the station.

800
01:26:04,120 --> 01:26:11,520
Fix, who had followed Mr. Fogg to the station, and saw that he was really going to leave Bombay, was there, upon the platform.

801
01:26:11,820 --> 01:26:16,320
He had resolved to follow the supposed robber to Calcutta, and farther, if necessary.

802
01:26:16,980 --> 01:26:26,520
Passepartout did not observe the detective, who stood in an obscure corner; but Fix heard him relate his adventures in a few words to Mr. Fogg.

803
01:26:27,160 --> 01:26:33,000
"I hope that this will not happen again," said Phileas Fogg coldly, as he got into the train.

804
01:26:33,740 --> 01:26:38,760
Poor Passepartout, quite crestfallen, followed his master without a word.

805
01:26:38,840 --> 01:26:44,960
Fix was on the point of entering another carriage, when an idea struck him which induced him to alter his plan.

806
01:26:45,659 --> 01:26:47,980
"No, I'll stay," muttered he.

807
01:26:48,540 --> 01:26:51,120
"An offence has been committed on Indian soil.

808
01:26:51,520 --> 01:26:52,920
I've got my man."

809
01:26:53,820 --> 01:27:00,120
Just then the locomotive gave a sharp screech, and the train passed out into the darkness of the night.

Chapter 11

816
01:27:25,550 --> 01:27:32,179
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SECURES A CURIOUS MEANS OF CONVEYANCE AT A FABULOUS PRICE

817
01:27:32,920 --> 01:27:34,660
The train had started punctually.

818
01:27:35,160 --> 01:27:43,840
Among the passengers were a number of officers, Government officials, and opium and indigo merchants, whose business called them to the eastern coast.

819
01:27:44,540 --> 01:27:50,900
Passepartout rode in the same carriage with his master, and a third passenger occupied a seat opposite to them.

820
01:27:51,520 --> 01:28:00,160
This was Sir Francis Cromarty, one of Mr. Fogg's whist partners on the Mongolia, now on his way to join his corps at Benares.

821
01:28:00,800 --> 01:28:07,400
Sir Francis was a tall, fair man of fifty, who had greatly distinguished himself in the last Sepoy revolt.

822
01:28:08,100 --> 01:28:19,060
He made India his home, only paying brief visits to England at rare intervals; and was almost as familiar as a native with the customs, history, and character of India and its people.

823
01:28:20,000 --> 01:28:34,880
But Phileas Fogg, who was not travelling, but only describing a circumference, took no pains to inquire into these subjects; he was a solid body, traversing an orbit around the terrestrial globe, according to the laws of rational mechanics.

824
01:28:35,340 --> 01:28:47,400
He was at this moment calculating in his mind the number of hours spent since his departure from London, and, had it been in his nature to make a useless demonstration, would have rubbed his hands for satisfaction.

825
01:28:48,079 --> 01:29:09,760
Sir Francis Cromarty had observed the oddity of his travelling companion--although the only opportunity he had for studying him had been while he was dealing the cards, and between two rubbers--and questioned himself whether a human heart really beat beneath this cold exterior, and whether Phileas Fogg had any sense of the beauties of nature.

826
01:29:10,660 --> 01:29:21,040
The brigadier-general was free to mentally confess that, of all the eccentric persons he had ever met, none was comparable to this product of the exact sciences.

827
01:29:21,740 --> 01:29:36,740
Phileas Fogg had not concealed from Sir Francis his design of going round the world, nor the circumstances under which he set out; and the general only saw in the wager a useless eccentricity and a lack of sound common sense.

828
01:29:37,300 --> 01:29:44,340
In the way this strange gentleman was going on, he would leave the world without having done any good to himself or anybody else.

829
01:29:45,440 --> 01:29:52,500
An hour after leaving Bombay the train had passed the viaducts and the Island of Salcette, and had got into the open country.

830
01:29:53,060 --> 01:30:10,139
At Callyan they reached the junction of the branch line which descends towards south-eastern India by Kandallah and Pounah; and, passing Pauwell, they entered the defiles of the mountains, with their basalt bases, and their summits crowned with thick and verdant forests.

831
01:30:10,900 --> 01:30:27,219
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty exchanged a few words from time to time, and now Sir Francis, reviving the conversation, observed, "Some years ago, Mr. Fogg, you would have met with a delay at this point which would probably have lost you your wager."

832
01:30:27,800 --> 01:30:29,620
"How so, Sir Francis?"

833
01:30:30,120 --> 01:30:39,180
"Because the railway stopped at the base of these mountains, which the passengers were obliged to cross in palanquins or on ponies to Kandallah, on the other side."

834
01:30:39,880 --> 01:30:44,580
"Such a delay would not have deranged my plans in the least," said Mr. Fogg.

835
01:30:45,080 --> 01:30:49,220
"I have constantly foreseen the likelihood of certain obstacles."

836
01:30:49,760 --> 01:30:57,440
"But, Mr. Fogg," pursued Sir Francis, "you run the risk of having some difficulty about this worthy fellow's adventure at the pagoda."

837
01:30:57,980 --> 01:31:05,840
Passepartout, his feet comfortably wrapped in his travelling-blanket, was sound asleep and did not dream that anybody was talking about him.

838
01:31:06,739 --> 01:31:09,780
"The Government is very severe upon that kind of offence.

839
01:31:10,020 --> 01:31:16,940
It takes particular care that the religious customs of the Indians should be respected, and if your servant were caught--"

840
01:31:17,540 --> 01:31:27,020
"Very well, Sir Francis," replied Mr. Fogg; "if he had been caught he would have been condemned and punished, and then would have quietly returned to Europe.

841
01:31:27,060 --> 01:31:30,260
I don't see how this affair could have delayed his master."

842
01:31:30,960 --> 01:31:32,520
The conversation fell again.

843
01:31:33,280 --> 01:31:46,440
During the night the train left the mountains behind, and passed Nassik, and the next day proceeded over the flat, well-cultivated country of the Khandeish, with its straggling villages, above which rose the minarets of the pagodas.

844
01:31:47,140 --> 01:31:54,720
This fertile territory is watered by numerous small rivers and limpid streams, mostly tributaries of the Godavery.

845
01:31:55,980 --> 01:32:03,120
Passepartout, on waking and looking out, could not realise that he was actually crossing India in a railway train.

846
01:32:03,860 --> 01:32:30,480
The locomotive, guided by an English engineer and fed with English coal, threw out its smoke upon cotton, coffee, nutmeg, clove, and pepper plantations, while the steam curled in spirals around groups of palm-trees, in the midst of which were seen picturesque bungalows, viharis (sort of abandoned monasteries), and marvellous temples enriched by the exhaustless ornamentation of Indian architecture.

847
01:32:31,400 --> 01:32:50,060
Then they came upon vast tracts extending to the horizon, with jungles inhabited by snakes and tigers, which fled at the noise of the train; succeeded by forests penetrated by the railway, and still haunted by elephants which, with pensive eyes, gazed at the train as it passed.

848
01:32:50,880 --> 01:32:58,980
The travellers crossed, beyond Milligaum, the fatal country so often stained with blood by the sectaries of the goddess Kali.

849
01:32:59,739 --> 01:33:13,840
Not far off rose Ellora, with its graceful pagodas, and the famous Aurungabad, capital of the ferocious Aureng-Zeb, now the chief town of one of the detached provinces of the kingdom of the Nizam.

850
01:33:13,860 --> 01:33:19,760
It was thereabouts that Feringhea, the Thuggee chief, king of the stranglers, held his sway.

851
01:33:20,280 --> 01:33:36,600
These ruffians, united by a secret bond, strangled victims of every age in honour of the goddess Death, without ever shedding blood; there was a period when this part of the country could scarcely be travelled over without corpses being found in every direction.

852
01:33:37,260 --> 01:33:46,560
The English Government has succeeded in greatly diminishing these murders, though the Thuggees still exist, and pursue the exercise of their horrible rites.

853
01:33:47,700 --> 01:34:01,060
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Burhampoor where Passepartout was able to purchase some Indian slippers, ornamented with false pearls, in which, with evident vanity, he proceeded to encase his feet.

854
01:34:01,940 --> 01:34:12,520
The travellers made a hasty breakfast and started off for Assurghur, after skirting for a little the banks of the small river Tapty, which empties into the Gulf of Cambray, near Surat.

855
01:34:13,640 --> 01:34:17,060
Passepartout was now plunged into absorbing reverie.

856
01:34:17,620 --> 01:34:30,860
Up to his arrival at Bombay, he had entertained hopes that their journey would end there; but, now that they were plainly whirling across India at full speed, a sudden change had come over the spirit of his dreams.

857
01:34:30,880 --> 01:34:37,460
His old vagabond nature returned to him; the fantastic ideas of his youth once more took possession of him.

858
01:34:38,080 --> 01:34:50,720
He came to regard his master's project as intended in good earnest, believed in the reality of the bet, and therefore in the tour of the world and the necessity of making it without fail within the designated period.

859
01:34:51,320 --> 01:34:56,440
Already he began to worry about possible delays, and accidents which might happen on the way.

860
01:34:56,840 --> 01:35:07,400
He recognised himself as being personally interested in the wager, and trembled at the thought that he might have been the means of losing it by his unpardonable folly of the night before.

861
01:35:08,060 --> 01:35:24,640
Being much less cool-headed than Mr. Fogg, he was much more restless, counting and recounting the days passed over, uttering maledictions when the train stopped, and accusing it of sluggishness, and mentally blaming Mr. Fogg for not having bribed the engineer.

862
01:35:25,440 --> 01:35:33,280
The worthy fellow was ignorant that, while it was possible by such means to hasten the rate of a steamer, it could not be done on the railway.

863
01:35:34,300 --> 01:35:40,660
The train entered the defiles of the Sutpour Mountains, which separate the Khandeish from Bundelcund, towards evening.

864
01:35:41,480 --> 01:35:50,200
The next day Sir Francis Cromarty asked Passepartout what time it was; to which, on consulting his watch, he replied that it was three in the morning.

865
01:35:50,940 --> 01:35:59,780
This famous timepiece, always regulated on the Greenwich meridian, which was now some seventy-seven degrees westward, was at least four hours slow.

866
01:36:00,460 --> 01:36:26,920
Sir Francis corrected Passepartout's time, whereupon the latter made the same remark that he had done to Fix; and upon the general insisting that the watch should be regulated in each new meridian, since he was constantly going eastward, that is in the face of the sun, and therefore the days were shorter by four minutes for each degree gone over, Passepartout obstinately refused to alter his watch, which he kept at London time.

867
01:36:26,940 --> 01:36:29,800
It was an innocent delusion which could harm no one.

868
01:36:30,840 --> 01:36:39,620
The train stopped, at eight o'clock, in the midst of a glade some fifteen miles beyond Rothal, where there were several bungalows, and workmen's cabins.

869
01:36:40,240 --> 01:36:44,920
The conductor, passing along the carriages, shouted, "Passengers will get out here!"

870
01:36:45,600 --> 01:36:55,260
Phileas Fogg looked at Sir Francis Cromarty for an explanation; but the general could not tell what meant a halt in the midst of this forest of dates and acacias.

871
01:36:55,900 --> 01:37:03,600
Passepartout, not less surprised, rushed out and speedily returned, crying: "Monsieur, no more railway!"

872
01:37:04,300 --> 01:37:05,520
"What do you mean?"

873
01:37:05,540 --> 01:37:06,460
asked Sir Francis.

874
01:37:06,980 --> 01:37:09,460
"I mean to say that the train isn't going on."

875
01:37:10,020 --> 01:37:16,480
The general at once stepped out, while Phileas Fogg calmly followed him, and they proceeded together to the conductor.

876
01:37:17,100 --> 01:37:17,659
"Where are we?"

877
01:37:18,060 --> 01:37:18,920
asked Sir Francis.

878
01:37:19,420 --> 01:37:20,920
"At the hamlet of Kholby."

879
01:37:21,540 --> 01:37:22,380
"Do we stop here?"

880
01:37:22,980 --> 01:37:23,580
"Certainly.

881
01:37:23,620 --> 01:37:25,179
The railway isn't finished."

882
01:37:25,920 --> 01:37:26,320
"What!

883
01:37:26,580 --> 01:37:27,360
not finished?"

884
01:37:28,180 --> 01:37:28,660
"No.

885
01:37:28,760 --> 01:37:34,920
There's still a matter of fifty miles to be laid from here to Allahabad, where the line begins again."

886
01:37:35,700 --> 01:37:39,040
"But the papers announced the opening of the railway throughout."

887
01:37:39,580 --> 01:37:40,920
"What would you have, officer?

888
01:37:41,140 --> 01:37:42,580
The papers were mistaken."

889
01:37:43,200 --> 01:37:48,699
"Yet you sell tickets from Bombay to Calcutta," retorted Sir Francis, who was growing warm.

890
01:37:49,320 --> 01:37:58,320
"No doubt," replied the conductor; "but the passengers know that they must provide means of transportation for themselves from Kholby to Allahabad."

891
01:37:59,020 --> 01:38:00,620
Sir Francis was furious.

892
01:38:01,060 --> 01:38:06,980
Passepartout would willingly have knocked the conductor down, and did not dare to look at his master.

893
01:38:07,820 --> 01:38:15,300
"Sir Francis," said Mr. Fogg quietly, "we will, if you please, look about for some means of conveyance to Allahabad."

894
01:38:16,320 --> 01:38:19,760
"Mr. Fogg, this is a delay greatly to your disadvantage."

895
01:38:20,580 --> 01:38:22,800
"No, Sir Francis; it was foreseen."

896
01:38:23,660 --> 01:38:24,100
"What!

897
01:38:24,360 --> 01:38:25,800
You knew that the way--"

898
01:38:26,240 --> 01:38:31,160
"Not at all; but I knew that some obstacle or other would sooner or later arise on my route.

899
01:38:31,780 --> 01:38:33,140
Nothing, therefore, is lost.

900
01:38:33,480 --> 01:38:36,980
I have two days, which I have already gained, to sacrifice.

901
01:38:37,620 --> 01:38:42,800
A steamer leaves Calcutta for Hong Kong at noon, on the 25th.

902
01:38:42,820 --> 01:38:46,420
This is the 22nd, and we shall reach Calcutta in time."

903
01:38:47,320 --> 01:38:50,320
There was nothing to say to so confident a response.

904
01:38:51,280 --> 01:38:56,180
It was but too true that the railway came to a termination at this point.

905
01:38:56,260 --> 01:39:03,940
The papers were like some watches, which have a way of getting too fast, and had been premature in their announcement of the completion of the line.

906
01:39:04,580 --> 01:39:22,639
The greater part of the travellers were aware of this interruption, and, leaving the train, they began to engage such vehicles as the village could provide four-wheeled palkigharis, waggons drawn by zebus, carriages that looked like perambulating pagodas, palanquins, ponies, and what not.

907
01:39:23,680 --> 01:39:30,320
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, after searching the village from end to end, came back without having found anything.

908
01:39:31,239 --> 01:39:33,880
"I shall go afoot," said Phileas Fogg.

909
01:39:34,660 --> 01:39:42,940
Passepartout, who had now rejoined his master, made a wry grimace, as he thought of his magnificent, but too frail Indian shoes.

910
01:39:43,560 --> 01:39:51,200
Happily he too had been looking about him, and, after a moment's hesitation, said, "Monsieur, I think I have found a means of conveyance."

911
01:39:51,719 --> 01:39:52,100
"What?"

912
01:39:52,800 --> 01:39:53,360
"An elephant!

913
01:39:53,720 --> 01:39:57,659
An elephant that belongs to an Indian who lives but a hundred steps from here."

914
01:39:58,460 --> 01:40:01,500
"Let's go and see the elephant," replied Mr. Fogg.

915
01:40:02,580 --> 01:40:08,520
They soon reached a small hut, near which, enclosed within some high palings, was the animal in question.

916
01:40:08,940 --> 01:40:13,560
An Indian came out of the hut, and, at their request, conducted them within the enclosure.

917
01:40:14,380 --> 01:40:21,080
The elephant, which its owner had reared, not for a beast of burden, but for warlike purposes, was half domesticated.

918
01:40:21,659 --> 01:40:35,820
The Indian had begun already, by often irritating him, and feeding him every three months on sugar and butter, to impart to him a ferocity not in his nature, this method being often employed by those who train the Indian elephants for battle.

919
01:40:36,660 --> 01:40:46,100
Happily, however, for Mr. Fogg, the animal's instruction in this direction had not gone far, and the elephant still preserved his natural gentleness.

920
01:40:46,860 --> 01:40:57,440
Kiouni--this was the name of the beast--could doubtless travel rapidly for a long time, and, in default of any other means of conveyance, Mr. Fogg resolved to hire him.

921
01:40:58,420 --> 01:41:09,500
But elephants are far from cheap in India, where they are becoming scarce, the males, which alone are suitable for circus shows, are much sought, especially as but few of them are domesticated.

922
01:41:10,300 --> 01:41:15,760
When therefore Mr. Fogg proposed to the Indian to hire Kiouni, he refused point-blank.

923
01:41:16,540 --> 01:41:22,800
Mr. Fogg persisted, offering the excessive sum of ten pounds an hour for the loan of the beast to Allahabad.

924
01:41:23,420 --> 01:41:24,140
Refused.

925
01:41:24,580 --> 01:41:25,420
Twenty pounds?

926
01:41:25,800 --> 01:41:26,739
Refused also.

927
01:41:27,300 --> 01:41:28,260
Forty pounds?

928
01:41:28,719 --> 01:41:29,780
Still refused.

929
01:41:30,560 --> 01:41:34,900
Passepartout jumped at each advance; but the Indian declined to be tempted.

930
01:41:35,540 --> 01:41:45,700
Yet the offer was an alluring one, for, supposing it took the elephant fifteen hours to reach Allahabad, his owner would receive no less than six hundred pounds sterling.

931
01:41:46,620 --> 01:41:54,840
Phileas Fogg, without getting in the least flurried, then proposed to purchase the animal outright, and at first offered a thousand pounds for him.

932
01:41:55,680 --> 01:42:00,200
The Indian, perhaps thinking he was going to make a great bargain, still refused.

933
01:42:00,880 --> 01:42:21,220
Sir Francis Cromarty took Mr. Fogg aside, and begged him to reflect before he went any further; to which that gentleman replied that he was not in the habit of acting rashly, that a bet of twenty thousand pounds was at stake, that the elephant was absolutely necessary to him, and that he would secure him if he had to pay twenty times his value.

934
01:42:22,080 --> 01:42:30,980
Returning to the Indian, whose small, sharp eyes, glistening with avarice, betrayed that with him it was only a question of how great a price he could obtain.

935
01:42:31,580 --> 01:42:37,800
Mr. Fogg offered first twelve hundred, then fifteen hundred, eighteen hundred, two thousand pounds.

936
01:42:38,320 --> 01:42:43,100
Passepartout, usually so rubicund, was fairly white with suspense.

937
01:42:43,720 --> 01:42:46,320
At two thousand pounds the Indian yielded.

938
01:42:46,940 --> 01:42:49,179
"What a price, good heavens!"

939
01:42:49,520 --> 01:42:51,460
cried Passepartout, "for an elephant."

940
01:42:52,320 --> 01:42:56,280
It only remained now to find a guide, which was comparatively easy.

941
01:42:56,860 --> 01:43:07,100
A young Parsee, with an intelligent face, offered his services, which Mr. Fogg accepted, promising so generous a reward as to materially stimulate his zeal.

942
01:43:08,040 --> 01:43:09,880
The elephant was led out and equipped.

943
01:43:10,480 --> 01:43:20,980
The Parsee, who was an accomplished elephant driver, covered his back with a sort of saddle-cloth, and attached to each of his flanks some curiously uncomfortable howdahs.

944
01:43:21,539 --> 01:43:31,520
Phileas Fogg paid the Indian with some banknotes which he extracted from the famous carpet-bag, a proceeding that seemed to deprive poor Passepartout of his vitals.

945
01:43:32,040 --> 01:43:42,580
Then he offered to carry Sir Francis to Allahabad, which the brigadier gratefully accepted, as one traveller the more would not be likely to fatigue the gigantic beast.

946
01:43:43,380 --> 01:43:53,280
Provisions were purchased at Kholby, and, while Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg took the howdahs on either side, Passepartout got astride the saddle-cloth between them.

947
01:43:54,100 --> 01:44:04,280
The Parsee perched himself on the elephant's neck, and at nine o'clock they set out from the village, the animal marching off through the dense forest of palms by the shortest cut.

948

Chapter 12

954
01:44:30,130 --> 01:44:37,570
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND HIS COMPANIONS VENTURE ACROSS THE INDIAN FORESTS, AND WHAT ENSUED

955
01:44:37,580 --> 01:44:44,380
In order to shorten the journey, the guide passed to the left of the line where the railway was still in process of being built.

956
01:44:44,959 --> 01:44:51,400
This line, owing to the capricious turnings of the Vindhia Mountains, did not pursue a straight course.

957
01:44:51,980 --> 01:45:00,880
The Parsee, who was quite familiar with the roads and paths in the district, declared that they would gain twenty miles by striking directly through the forest.

958
01:45:01,640 --> 01:45:22,020
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty, plunged to the neck in the peculiar howdahs provided for them, were horribly jostled by the swift trotting of the elephant, spurred on as he was by the skilful Parsee; but they endured the discomfort with true British phlegm, talking little, and scarcely able to catch a glimpse of each other.

959
01:45:22,840 --> 01:45:39,260
As for Passepartout, who was mounted on the beast's back, and received the direct force of each concussion as he trod along, he was very careful, in accordance with his master's advice, to keep his tongue from between his teeth, as it would otherwise have been bitten off short.

960
01:45:39,920 --> 01:45:58,420
The worthy fellow bounced from the elephant's neck to his rump, and vaulted like a clown on a spring-board; yet he laughed in the midst of his bouncing, and from time to time took a piece of sugar out of his pocket, and inserted it in Kiouni's trunk, who received it without in the least slackening his regular trot.

961
01:45:59,520 --> 01:46:11,980
After two hours the guide stopped the elephant, and gave him an hour for rest, during which Kiouni, after quenching his thirst at a neighbouring spring, set to devouring the branches and shrubs round about him.

962
01:46:12,760 --> 01:46:18,539
Neither Sir Francis nor Mr. Fogg regretted the delay, and both descended with a feeling of relief.

963
01:46:19,280 --> 01:46:20,780
"Why, he's made of iron!"

964
01:46:20,800 --> 01:46:24,380
exclaimed the general, gazing admiringly on Kiouni.

965
01:46:25,000 --> 01:46:30,059
"Of forged iron," replied Passepartout, as he set about preparing a hasty breakfast.

966
01:46:31,159 --> 01:46:33,860
At noon the Parsee gave the signal of departure.

967
01:46:34,620 --> 01:46:37,559
The country soon presented a very savage aspect.

968
01:46:38,360 --> 01:46:48,920
Copses of dates and dwarf-palms succeeded the dense forests; then vast, dry plains, dotted with scanty shrubs, and sown with great blocks of syenite.

969
01:46:49,620 --> 01:47:00,660
All this portion of Bundelcund, which is little frequented by travellers, is inhabited by a fanatical population, hardened in the most horrible practices of the Hindoo faith.

970
01:47:01,320 --> 01:47:14,240
The English have not been able to secure complete dominion over this territory, which is subjected to the influence of rajahs, whom it is almost impossible to reach in their inaccessible mountain fastnesses.

971
01:47:14,980 --> 01:47:24,320
The travellers several times saw bands of ferocious Indians, who, when they perceived the elephant striding across-country, made angry and threatening motions.

972
01:47:24,980 --> 01:47:27,519
The Parsee avoided them as much as possible.

973
01:47:28,060 --> 01:47:37,140
Few animals were observed on the route; even the monkeys hurried from their path with contortions and grimaces which convulsed Passepartout with laughter.

974
01:47:38,080 --> 01:47:42,360
In the midst of his gaiety, however, one thought troubled the worthy servant.

975
01:47:42,940 --> 01:47:46,700
What would Mr. Fogg do with the elephant when he got to Allahabad?

976
01:47:47,400 --> 01:47:49,199
Would he carry him on with him?

977
01:47:49,220 --> 01:47:49,919
Impossible!

978
01:47:50,440 --> 01:47:54,020
The cost of transporting him would make him ruinously expensive.

979
01:47:54,860 --> 01:47:56,820
Would he sell him, or set him free?

980
01:47:57,720 --> 01:48:01,140
The estimable beast certainly deserved some consideration.

981
01:48:01,740 --> 01:48:12,040
Should Mr. Fogg choose to make him, Passepartout, a present of Kiouni, he would be very much embarrassed; and these thoughts did not cease worrying him for a long time.

982
01:48:13,120 --> 01:48:21,140
The principal chain of the Vindhias was crossed by eight in the evening, and another halt was made on the northern slope, in a ruined bungalow.

983
01:48:21,760 --> 01:48:28,900
They had gone nearly twenty-five miles that day, and an equal distance still separated them from the station of Allahabad.

984
01:48:29,880 --> 01:48:30,960
The night was cold.

985
01:48:31,060 --> 01:48:43,239
The Parsee lit a fire in the bungalow with a few dry branches, and the warmth was very grateful, provisions purchased at Kholby sufficed for supper, and the travellers ate ravenously.

986
01:48:44,000 --> 01:48:50,400
The conversation, beginning with a few disconnected phrases, soon gave place to loud and steady snores.

987
01:48:51,080 --> 01:48:56,840
The guide watched Kiouni, who slept standing, bolstering himself against the trunk of a large tree.

988
01:48:57,900 --> 01:49:12,719
Nothing occurred during the night to disturb the slumberers, although occasional growls from panthers and chatterings of monkeys broke the silence; the more formidable beasts made no cries or hostile demonstration against the occupants of the bungalow.

989
01:49:13,500 --> 01:49:17,640
Sir Francis slept heavily, like an honest soldier overcome with fatigue.

990
01:49:18,519 --> 01:49:22,999
Passepartout was wrapped in uneasy dreams of the bouncing of the day before.

991
01:49:23,720 --> 01:49:30,739
As for Mr. Fogg, he slumbered as peacefully as if he had been in his serene mansion in Saville Row.

992
01:49:30,760 --> 01:49:36,240
The journey was resumed at six in the morning; the guide hoped to reach Allahabad by evening.

993
01:49:36,260 --> 01:49:42,720
In that case, Mr. Fogg would only lose a part of the forty-eight hours saved since the beginning of the tour.

994
01:49:43,460 --> 01:49:55,200
Kiouni, resuming his rapid gait, soon descended the lower spurs of the Vindhias, and towards noon they passed by the village of Kallenger, on the Cani, one of the branches of the Ganges.

995
01:49:55,720 --> 01:50:04,800
The guide avoided inhabited places, thinking it safer to keep the open country, which lies along the first depressions of the basin of the great river.

996
01:50:04,820 --> 01:50:08,079
Allahabad was now only twelve miles to the north-east.

997
01:50:08,800 --> 01:50:17,480
They stopped under a clump of bananas, the fruit of which, as healthy as bread and as succulent as cream, was amply partaken of and appreciated.

998
01:50:18,380 --> 01:50:25,460
At two o'clock the guide entered a thick forest which extended several miles; he preferred to travel under cover of the woods.

999
01:50:25,900 --> 01:50:35,720
They had not as yet had any unpleasant encounters, and the journey seemed on the point of being successfully accomplished, when the elephant, becoming restless, suddenly stopped.

1000
01:50:36,060 --> 01:50:37,320
It was then four o'clock.

1001
01:50:37,920 --> 01:50:38,920
"What's the matter?"

1002
01:50:38,940 --> 01:50:40,700
asked Sir Francis, putting out his head.

1003
01:50:41,340 --> 01:50:48,280
"I don't know, officer," replied the Parsee, listening attentively to a confused murmur which came through the thick branches.

1004
01:50:48,800 --> 01:50:56,480
The murmur soon became more distinct; it now seemed like a distant concert of human voices accompanied by brass instruments.

1005
01:50:57,280 --> 01:50:59,639
Passepartout was all eyes and ears.

1006
01:51:00,020 --> 01:51:02,659
Mr. Fogg patiently waited without a word.

1007
01:51:03,420 --> 01:51:08,780
The Parsee jumped to the ground, fastened the elephant to a tree, and plunged into the thicket.

1008
01:51:09,280 --> 01:51:10,820
He soon returned, saying:

1009
01:51:11,060 --> 01:51:13,340
"A procession of Brahmins is coming this way.

1010
01:51:13,700 --> 01:51:15,920
We must prevent their seeing us, if possible."

1011
01:51:16,580 --> 01:51:22,600
The guide unloosed the elephant and led him into a thicket, at the same time asking the travellers not to stir.

1012
01:51:23,260 --> 01:51:37,660
He held himself ready to bestride the animal at a moment's notice, should flight become necessary; but he evidently thought that the procession of the faithful would pass without perceiving them amid the thick foliage, in which they were wholly concealed.

1013
01:51:38,720 --> 01:51:47,560
The discordant tones of the voices and instruments drew nearer, and now droning songs mingled with the sound of the tambourines and cymbals.

1014
01:51:48,180 --> 01:51:58,860
The head of the procession soon appeared beneath the trees, a hundred paces away; and the strange figures who performed the religious ceremony were easily distinguished through the branches.

1015
01:51:59,440 --> 01:52:04,420
First came the priests, with mitres on their heads, and clothed in long lace robes.

1016
01:52:04,880 --> 01:52:20,940
They were surrounded by men, women, and children, who sang a kind of lugubrious psalm, interrupted at regular intervals by the tambourines and cymbals; while behind them was drawn a car with large wheels, the spokes of which represented serpents entwined with each other.

1017
01:52:21,559 --> 01:52:36,160
Upon the car, which was drawn by four richly caparisoned zebus, stood a hideous statue with four arms, the body coloured a dull red, with haggard eyes, dishevelled hair, protruding tongue, and lips tinted with betel.

1018
01:52:36,860 --> 01:52:41,060
It stood upright upon the figure of a prostrate and headless giant.

1019
01:52:41,560 --> 01:52:48,240
Sir Francis, recognising the statue, whispered, "The goddess Kali; the goddess of love and death."

1020
01:52:48,780 --> 01:52:53,680
"Of death, perhaps," muttered back Passepartout, "but of love--that ugly old hag?

1021
01:52:54,140 --> 01:52:54,540
Never!"

1022
01:52:55,140 --> 01:52:57,660
The Parsee made a motion to keep silence.

1023
01:52:58,219 --> 01:53:15,860
A group of old fakirs were capering and making a wild ado round the statue; these were striped with ochre, and covered with cuts whence their blood issued drop by drop--stupid fanatics, who, in the great Indian ceremonies, still throw themselves under the wheels of Juggernaut.

1024
01:53:16,780 --> 01:53:24,260
Some Brahmins, clad in all the sumptuousness of Oriental apparel, and leading a woman who faltered at every step, followed.

1025
01:53:24,880 --> 01:53:27,780
This woman was young, and as fair as a European.

1026
01:53:28,460 --> 01:53:44,160
Her head and neck, shoulders, ears, arms, hands, and toes were loaded down with jewels and gems with bracelets, earrings, and rings; while a tunic bordered with gold, and covered with a light muslin robe, betrayed the outline of her form.

1027
01:53:44,820 --> 01:53:57,280
The guards who followed the young woman presented a violent contrast to her, armed as they were with naked sabres hung at their waists, and long damascened pistols, and bearing a corpse on a palanquin.

1028
01:53:57,900 --> 01:54:15,360
It was the body of an old man, gorgeously arrayed in the habiliments of a rajah, wearing, as in life, a turban embroidered with pearls, a robe of tissue of silk and gold, a scarf of cashmere sewed with diamonds, and the magnificent weapons of a Hindoo prince.

1029
01:54:15,979 --> 01:54:25,740
Next came the musicians and a rearguard of capering fakirs, whose cries sometimes drowned the noise of the instruments; these closed the procession.

1030
01:54:26,520 --> 01:54:32,600
Sir Francis watched the procession with a sad countenance, and, turning to the guide, said, "A suttee."

1031
01:54:33,079 --> 01:54:35,960
The Parsee nodded, and put his finger to his lips.

1032
01:54:36,480 --> 01:54:43,300
The procession slowly wound under the trees, and soon its last ranks disappeared in the depths of the wood.

1033
01:54:43,880 --> 01:54:51,760
The songs gradually died away; occasionally cries were heard in the distance, until at last all was silence again.

1034
01:54:52,640 --> 01:54:59,520
Phileas Fogg had heard what Sir Francis said, and, as soon as the procession had disappeared, asked: "What is a suttee?"

1035
01:55:00,280 --> 01:55:05,880
"A suttee," returned the general, "is a human sacrifice, but a voluntary one.

1036
01:55:06,480 --> 01:55:10,360
The woman you have just seen will be burned to-morrow at the dawn of day."

1037
01:55:11,019 --> 01:55:12,540
"Oh, the scoundrels!"

1038
01:55:12,719 --> 01:55:16,120
cried Passepartout, who could not repress his indignation.

1039
01:55:16,840 --> 01:55:17,980
"And the corpse?"

1040
01:55:18,159 --> 01:55:19,080
asked Mr. Fogg.

1041
01:55:19,300 --> 01:55:24,520
"Is that of the prince, her husband," said the guide; "an independent rajah of Bundelcund."

1042
01:55:25,440 --> 01:55:37,820
"Is it possible," resumed Phileas Fogg, his voice betraying not the least emotion, "that these barbarous customs still exist in India, and that the English have been unable to put a stop to them?"

1043
01:55:38,580 --> 01:55:49,600
"These sacrifices do not occur in the larger portion of India," replied Sir Francis; "but we have no power over these savage territories, and especially here in Bundelcund.

1044
01:55:49,699 --> 01:55:55,620
The whole district north of the Vindhias is the theatre of incessant murders and pillage."

1045
01:55:56,080 --> 01:55:57,099
"The poor wretch!"

1046
01:55:57,320 --> 01:56:00,400
exclaimed Passepartout, "to be burned alive!"

1047
01:56:01,320 --> 01:56:04,260
"Yes," returned Sir Francis, "burned alive.

1048
01:56:04,960 --> 01:56:11,440
And, if she were not, you cannot conceive what treatment she would be obliged to submit to from her relatives.

1049
01:56:11,900 --> 01:56:24,140
They would shave off her hair, feed her on a scanty allowance of rice, treat her with contempt; she would be looked upon as an unclean creature, and would die in some corner, like a scurvy dog.

1050
01:56:24,840 --> 01:56:33,280
The prospect of so frightful an existence drives these poor creatures to the sacrifice much more than love or religious fanaticism.

1051
01:56:34,160 --> 01:56:42,100
Sometimes, however, the sacrifice is really voluntary, and it requires the active interference of the Government to prevent it.

1052
01:56:42,660 --> 01:56:54,320
Several years ago, when I was living at Bombay, a young widow asked permission of the governor to be burned along with her husband's body; but, as you may imagine, he refused.

1053
01:56:54,820 --> 01:57:01,640
The woman left the town, took refuge with an independent rajah, and there carried out her self-devoted purpose."

1054
01:57:02,360 --> 01:57:12,780
While Sir Francis was speaking, the guide shook his head several times, and now said: "The sacrifice which will take place to-morrow at dawn is not a voluntary one."

1055
01:57:13,740 --> 01:57:14,620
"How do you know?"

1056
01:57:15,200 --> 01:57:17,800
"Everybody knows about this affair in Bundelcund."

1057
01:57:18,380 --> 01:57:23,780
"But the wretched creature did not seem to be making any resistance," observed Sir Francis.

1058
01:57:24,440 --> 01:57:28,460
"That was because they had intoxicated her with fumes of hemp and opium."

1059
01:57:29,200 --> 01:57:30,660
"But where are they taking her?"

1060
01:57:31,300 --> 01:57:35,920
"To the pagoda of Pillaji, two miles from here; she will pass the night there."

1061
01:57:36,800 --> 01:57:38,800
"And the sacrifice will take place--"

1062
01:57:39,300 --> 01:57:41,099
"To-morrow, at the first light of dawn."

1063
01:57:41,940 --> 01:57:45,920
The guide now led the elephant out of the thicket, and leaped upon his neck.

1064
01:57:46,480 --> 01:57:57,900
Just at the moment that he was about to urge Kiouni forward with a peculiar whistle, Mr. Fogg stopped him, and, turning to Sir Francis Cromarty, said, "Suppose we save this woman."

1065
01:57:58,460 --> 01:58:00,479
"Save the woman, Mr. Fogg!"

1066
01:58:01,079 --> 01:58:05,220
"I have yet twelve hours to spare; I can devote them to that."

1067
01:58:05,920 --> 01:58:07,600
"Why, you are a man of heart!"

1068
01:58:08,100 --> 01:58:12,340
"Sometimes," replied Phileas Fogg, quietly; "when I have the time."

1069
01:58:13,040 --> 01:58:16,100

Around the World in Eighty Days

Translated by George Makepeace Towle

Chapter 13

1075
01:58:39,230 --> 01:58:44,940
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT RECEIVES A NEW PROOF THAT FORTUNE FAVORS THE BRAVE

1076
01:58:45,680 --> 01:58:50,300
The project was a bold one, full of difficulty, perhaps impracticable.

1077
01:58:50,800 --> 01:58:56,159
Mr. Fogg was going to risk life, or at least liberty, and therefore the success of his tour.

1078
01:58:56,840 --> 01:59:02,540
But he did not hesitate, and he found in Sir Francis Cromarty an enthusiastic ally.

1079
01:59:03,520 --> 01:59:07,179
As for Passepartout, he was ready for anything that might be proposed.

1080
01:59:07,760 --> 01:59:13,600
His master's idea charmed him; he perceived a heart, a soul, under that icy exterior.

1081
01:59:14,260 --> 01:59:16,020
He began to love Phileas Fogg.

1082
01:59:16,860 --> 01:59:19,900
There remained the guide: what course would he adopt?

1083
01:59:20,479 --> 01:59:23,179
Would he not take part with the Indians?

1084
01:59:23,200 --> 01:59:27,580
In default of his assistance, it was necessary to be assured of his neutrality.

1085
01:59:28,440 --> 01:59:30,700
Sir Francis frankly put the question to him.

1086
01:59:31,260 --> 01:59:36,040
"Officers," replied the guide, "I am a Parsee, and this woman is a Parsee.

1087
01:59:36,640 --> 01:59:37,980
Command me as you will."

1088
01:59:38,760 --> 01:59:39,320
"Excellent!"

1089
01:59:39,679 --> 01:59:40,459
said Mr. Fogg.

1090
01:59:41,180 --> 01:59:48,840
"However," resumed the guide, "it is certain, not only that we shall risk our lives, but horrible tortures, if we are taken."

1091
01:59:49,540 --> 01:59:52,100
"That is foreseen," replied Mr. Fogg.

1092
01:59:52,800 --> 01:59:55,820
"I think we must wait till night before acting."

1093
01:59:56,680 --> 01:59:58,500
"I think so," said the guide.

1094
01:59:59,240 --> 02:00:08,360
The worthy Indian then gave some account of the victim, who, he said, was a celebrated beauty of the Parsee race, and the daughter of a wealthy Bombay merchant.

1095
02:00:08,900 --> 02:00:16,100
She had received a thoroughly English education in that city, and, from her manners and intelligence, would be thought an European.

1096
02:00:16,700 --> 02:00:18,060
Her name was Aouda.

1097
02:00:18,600 --> 02:00:34,739
Left an orphan, she was married against her will to the old rajah of Bundelcund; and, knowing the fate that awaited her, she escaped, was retaken, and devoted by the rajah's relatives, who had an interest in her death, to the sacrifice from which it seemed she could not escape.

1098
02:00:35,560 --> 02:00:41,380
The Parsee's narrative only confirmed Mr. Fogg and his companions in their generous design.

1099
02:00:42,080 --> 02:00:50,260
It was decided that the guide should direct the elephant towards the pagoda of Pillaji, which he accordingly approached as quickly as possible.

1100
02:00:50,980 --> 02:01:02,720
They halted, half an hour afterwards, in a copse, some five hundred feet from the pagoda, where they were well concealed; but they could hear the groans and cries of the fakirs distinctly.

1101
02:01:03,680 --> 02:01:06,360
They then discussed the means of getting at the victim.

1102
02:01:06,980 --> 02:01:13,000
The guide was familiar with the pagoda of Pillaji, in which, as he declared, the young woman was imprisoned.

1103
02:01:13,560 --> 02:01:22,480
Could they enter any of its doors while the whole party of Indians was plunged in a drunken sleep, or was it safer to attempt to make a hole in the walls?

1104
02:01:23,200 --> 02:01:35,500
This could only be determined at the moment and the place themselves; but it was certain that the abduction must be made that night, and not when, at break of day, the victim was led to her funeral pyre.

1105
02:01:36,060 --> 02:01:38,500
Then no human intervention could save her.

1106
02:01:39,400 --> 02:01:45,160
As soon as night fell, about six o'clock, they decided to make a reconnaissance around the pagoda.

1107
02:01:45,800 --> 02:01:58,820
The cries of the fakirs were just ceasing; the Indians were in the act of plunging themselves into the drunkenness caused by liquid opium mingled with hemp, and it might be possible to slip between them to the temple itself.

1108
02:01:59,600 --> 02:02:18,000
The Parsee, leading the others, noiselessly crept through the wood, and in ten minutes they found themselves on the banks of a small stream, whence, by the light of the rosin torches, they perceived a pyre of wood, on the top of which lay the embalmed body of the rajah, which was to be burned with his wife.

1109
02:02:18,800 --> 02:02:25,040
The pagoda, whose minarets loomed above the trees in the deepening dusk, stood a hundred steps away.

1110
02:02:25,660 --> 02:02:26,160
"Come!"

1111
02:02:26,539 --> 02:02:27,280
whispered the guide.

1112
02:02:28,120 --> 02:02:38,159
He slipped more cautiously than ever through the brush, followed by his companions; the silence around was only broken by the low murmuring of the wind among the branches.

1113
02:02:38,980 --> 02:02:43,660
Soon the Parsee stopped on the borders of the glade, which was lit up by the torches.

1114
02:02:44,180 --> 02:02:51,639
The ground was covered by groups of the Indians, motionless in their drunken sleep; it seemed a battlefield strewn with the dead.

1115
02:02:52,280 --> 02:02:54,460
Men, women, and children lay together.

1116
02:02:55,380 --> 02:03:00,020
In the background, among the trees, the pagoda of Pillaji loomed distinctly.

1117
02:03:00,680 --> 02:03:12,800
Much to the guide's disappointment, the guards of the rajah, lighted by torches, were watching at the doors and marching to and fro with naked sabres; probably the priests, too, were watching within.

1118
02:03:13,600 --> 02:03:21,679
The Parsee, now convinced that it was impossible to force an entrance to the temple, advanced no farther, but led his companions back again.

1119
02:03:22,360 --> 02:03:27,820
Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis Cromarty also saw that nothing could be attempted in that direction.

1120
02:03:28,360 --> 02:03:31,280
They stopped, and engaged in a whispered colloquy.

1121
02:03:31,940 --> 02:03:37,320
"It is only eight now," said the brigadier, "and these guards may also go to sleep."

1122
02:03:37,860 --> 02:03:40,739
"It is not impossible," returned the Parsee.

1123
02:03:41,580 --> 02:03:43,900
They lay down at the foot of a tree, and waited.

1124
02:03:44,860 --> 02:03:58,300
The time seemed long; the guide ever and anon left them to take an observation on the edge of the wood, but the guards watched steadily by the glare of the torches, and a dim light crept through the windows of the pagoda.

1125
02:03:59,159 --> 02:04:07,500
They waited till midnight; but no change took place among the guards, and it became apparent that their yielding to sleep could not be counted on.

1126
02:04:08,320 --> 02:04:13,140
The other plan must be carried out; an opening in the walls of the pagoda must be made.

1127
02:04:13,820 --> 02:04:21,020
It remained to ascertain whether the priests were watching by the side of their victim as assiduously as were the soldiers at the door.

1128
02:04:21,800 --> 02:04:28,880
After a last consultation, the guide announced that he was ready for the attempt, and advanced, followed by the others.

1129
02:04:29,440 --> 02:04:33,160
They took a roundabout way, so as to get at the pagoda on the rear.

1130
02:04:33,860 --> 02:04:42,100
They reached the walls about half-past twelve, without having met anyone; here there was no guard, nor were there either windows or doors.

1131
02:04:42,560 --> 02:04:44,020
The night was dark.

1132
02:04:44,260 --> 02:04:52,300
The moon, on the wane, scarcely left the horizon, and was covered with heavy clouds; the height of the trees deepened the darkness.

1133
02:04:53,099 --> 02:05:01,559
It was not enough to reach the walls; an opening in them must be accomplished, and to attain this purpose the party only had their pocket-knives.

1134
02:05:02,120 --> 02:05:11,979
Happily the temple walls were built of brick and wood, which could be penetrated with little difficulty; after one brick had been taken out, the rest would yield easily.

1135
02:05:12,660 --> 02:05:22,420
They set noiselessly to work, and the Parsee on one side and Passepartout on the other began to loosen the bricks so as to make an aperture two feet wide.

1136
02:05:23,300 --> 02:05:31,880
They were getting on rapidly, when suddenly a cry was heard in the interior of the temple, followed almost instantly by other cries replying from the outside.

1137
02:05:32,580 --> 02:05:34,320
Passepartout and the guide stopped.

1138
02:05:34,680 --> 02:05:35,500
Had they been heard?

1139
02:05:36,000 --> 02:05:37,160
Was the alarm being given?

1140
02:05:37,700 --> 02:05:43,420
Common prudence urged them to retire, and they did so, followed by Phileas Fogg and Sir Francis.

1141
02:05:44,000 --> 02:05:52,939
They again hid themselves in the wood, and waited till the disturbance, whatever it might be, ceased, holding themselves ready to resume their attempt without delay.

1142
02:05:53,860 --> 02:06:01,539
But, awkwardly enough, the guards now appeared at the rear of the temple, and there installed themselves, in readiness to prevent a surprise.

1143
02:06:02,200 --> 02:06:07,400
It would be difficult to describe the disappointment of the party, thus interrupted in their work.

1144
02:06:07,840 --> 02:06:11,120
They could not now reach the victim; how, then, could they save her?

1145
02:06:11,680 --> 02:06:18,500
Sir Francis shook his fists, Passepartout was beside himself, and the guide gnashed his teeth with rage.

1146
02:06:19,260 --> 02:06:22,940
The tranquil Fogg waited, without betraying any emotion.

1147
02:06:23,800 --> 02:06:27,460
"We have nothing to do but to go away," whispered Sir Francis.

1148
02:06:27,940 --> 02:06:30,480
"Nothing but to go away," echoed the guide.

1149
02:06:31,340 --> 02:06:32,700
"Stop," said Fogg.

1150
02:06:33,260 --> 02:06:36,440
"I am only due at Allahabad tomorrow before noon."

1151
02:06:37,080 --> 02:06:38,420
"But what can you hope to do?"

1152
02:06:39,019 --> 02:06:39,960
asked Sir Francis.

1153
02:06:40,300 --> 02:06:42,460
"In a few hours it will be daylight, and--"

1154
02:06:42,880 --> 02:06:46,980
"The chance which now seems lost may present itself at the last moment."

1155
02:06:47,659 --> 02:06:51,220
Sir Francis would have liked to read Phileas Fogg's eyes.

1156
02:06:51,639 --> 02:06:53,820
What was this cool Englishman thinking of?

1157
02:06:54,300 --> 02:07:01,260
Was he planning to make a rush for the young woman at the very moment of the sacrifice, and boldly snatch her from her executioners?

1158
02:07:02,000 --> 02:07:06,160
This would be utter folly, and it was hard to admit that Fogg was such a fool.

1159
02:07:06,860 --> 02:07:10,960
Sir Francis consented, however, to remain to the end of this terrible drama.

1160
02:07:11,680 --> 02:07:16,760
The guide led them to the rear of the glade, where they were able to observe the sleeping groups.

1161
02:07:17,559 --> 02:07:29,219
Meanwhile Passepartout, who had perched himself on the lower branches of a tree, was resolving an idea which had at first struck him like a flash, and which was now firmly lodged in his brain.

1162
02:07:29,880 --> 02:07:33,780
He had commenced by saying to himself, "What folly!"

1163
02:07:33,800 --> 02:07:36,140
and then he repeated, "Why not, after all?

1164
02:07:36,640 --> 02:07:40,680
It's a chance,--perhaps the only one; and with such sots!"

1165
02:07:41,340 --> 02:07:48,420
Thinking thus, he slipped, with the suppleness of a serpent, to the lowest branches, the ends of which bent almost to the ground.

1166
02:07:49,580 --> 02:07:55,860
The hours passed, and the lighter shades now announced the approach of day, though it was not yet light.

1167
02:07:56,440 --> 02:07:57,400
This was the moment.

1168
02:07:58,000 --> 02:08:06,080
The slumbering multitude became animated, the tambourines sounded, songs and cries arose; the hour of the sacrifice had come.

1169
02:08:06,699 --> 02:08:15,780
The doors of the pagoda swung open, and a bright light escaped from its interior, in the midst of which Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis espied the victim.

1170
02:08:16,400 --> 02:08:22,619
She seemed, having shaken off the stupor of intoxication, to be striving to escape from her executioner.

1171
02:08:23,340 --> 02:08:30,040
Sir Francis's heart throbbed; and, convulsively seizing Mr. Fogg's hand, found in it an open knife.

1172
02:08:30,619 --> 02:08:33,460
Just at this moment the crowd began to move.

1173
02:08:33,579 --> 02:08:43,760
The young woman had again fallen into a stupor caused by the fumes of hemp, and passed among the fakirs, who escorted her with their wild, religious cries.

1174
02:08:44,660 --> 02:08:57,219
Phileas Fogg and his companions, mingling in the rear ranks of the crowd, followed; and in two minutes they reached the banks of the stream, and stopped fifty paces from the pyre, upon which still lay the rajah's corpse.

1175
02:08:58,060 --> 02:09:04,380
In the semi-obscurity they saw the victim, quite senseless, stretched out beside her husband's body.

1176
02:09:05,140 --> 02:09:10,320
Then a torch was brought, and the wood, heavily soaked with oil, instantly took fire.

1177
02:09:10,980 --> 02:09:18,740
At this moment Sir Francis and the guide seized Phileas Fogg, who, in an instant of mad generosity, was about to rush upon the pyre.

1178
02:09:19,219 --> 02:09:23,260
But he had quickly pushed them aside, when the whole scene suddenly changed.

1179
02:09:23,680 --> 02:09:25,480
A cry of terror arose.

1180
02:09:25,659 --> 02:09:29,760
The whole multitude prostrated themselves, terror-stricken, on the ground.

1181
02:09:30,380 --> 02:09:43,460
The old rajah was not dead, then, since he rose of a sudden, like a spectre, took up his wife in his arms, and descended from the pyre in the midst of the clouds of smoke, which only heightened his ghostly appearance.

1182
02:09:44,100 --> 02:09:53,520
Fakirs and soldiers and priests, seized with instant terror, lay there, with their faces on the ground, not daring to lift their eyes and behold such a prodigy.

1183
02:09:54,160 --> 02:10:01,360
The inanimate victim was borne along by the vigorous arms which supported her, and which she did not seem in the least to burden.

1184
02:10:02,060 --> 02:10:10,320
Mr. Fogg and Sir Francis stood erect, the Parsee bowed his head, and Passepartout was, no doubt, scarcely less stupefied.

1185
02:10:11,340 --> 02:10:18,620
The resuscitated rajah approached Sir Francis and Mr. Fogg, and, in an abrupt tone, said, "Let us be off!"

1186
02:10:19,080 --> 02:10:29,739
It was Passepartout himself, who had slipped upon the pyre in the midst of the smoke and, profiting by the still overhanging darkness, had delivered the young woman from death!

1187
02:10:29,820 --> 02:10:36,540
It was Passepartout who, playing his part with a happy audacity, had passed through the crowd amid the general terror.

1188
02:10:37,380 --> 02:10:44,459
A moment after all four of the party had disappeared in the woods, and the elephant was bearing them away at a rapid pace.

1189
02:10:45,099 --> 02:10:53,120
But the cries and noise, and a ball which whizzed through Phileas Fogg's hat, apprised them that the trick had been discovered.

1190
02:10:54,260 --> 02:11:03,719
The old rajah's body, indeed, now appeared upon the burning pyre; and the priests, recovered from their terror, perceived that an abduction had taken place.

1191
02:11:04,219 --> 02:11:17,580
They hastened into the forest, followed by the soldiers, who fired a volley after the fugitives; but the latter rapidly increased the distance between them, and ere long found themselves beyond the reach of the bullets and arrows.

1192
02:11:18,230 --> 02:11:21,579

Around the World in Eighty Days
by
Jules Verne

1196
02:11:39,210 --> 02:11:42,570
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

1197
02:11:42,570 --> 02:11:44,730
Chapter 14

1198
02:11:44,730 --> 02:11:52,720
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DESCENDS THE WHOLE LENGTH OF THE BEAUTIFUL VALLEY OF THE GANGES WITHOUT EVER THINKING OF SEEING IT

1199
02:11:53,240 --> 02:11:59,600
The rash exploit had been accomplished; and for an hour Passepartout laughed gaily at his success.

1200
02:12:00,100 --> 02:12:05,059
Sir Francis pressed the worthy fellow's hand, and his master said, "Well done!"

1201
02:12:05,699 --> 02:12:12,840
which, from him, was high commendation; to which Passepartout replied that all the credit of the affair belonged to Mr. Fogg.

1202
02:12:13,400 --> 02:12:28,800
As for him, he had only been struck with a "queer" idea; and he laughed to think that for a few moments he, Passepartout, the ex-gymnast, ex-sergeant fireman, had been the spouse of a charming woman, a venerable, embalmed rajah!

1203
02:12:28,820 --> 02:12:38,519
As for the young Indian woman, she had been unconscious throughout of what was passing, and now, wrapped up in a travelling-blanket, was reposing in one of the howdahs.

1204
02:12:39,380 --> 02:12:50,079
The elephant, thanks to the skilful guidance of the Parsee, was advancing rapidly through the still darksome forest, and, an hour after leaving the pagoda, had crossed a vast plain.

1205
02:12:50,880 --> 02:12:56,420
They made a halt at seven o'clock, the young woman being still in a state of complete prostration.

1206
02:12:57,179 --> 02:13:04,180
The guide made her drink a little brandy and water, but the drowsiness which stupefied her could not yet be shaken off.

1207
02:13:04,619 --> 02:13:12,520
Sir Francis, who was familiar with the effects of the intoxication produced by the fumes of hemp, reassured his companions on her account.

1208
02:13:13,340 --> 02:13:16,500
But he was more disturbed at the prospect of her future fate.

1209
02:13:17,220 --> 02:13:25,159
He told Phileas Fogg that, should Aouda remain in India, she would inevitably fall again into the hands of her executioners.

1210
02:13:25,720 --> 02:13:33,860
These fanatics were scattered throughout the county, and would, despite the English police, recover their victim at Madras, Bombay, or Calcutta.

1211
02:13:34,320 --> 02:13:37,280
She would only be safe by quitting India for ever.

1212
02:13:38,480 --> 02:13:41,440
Phileas Fogg replied that he would reflect upon the matter.

1213
02:13:42,440 --> 02:13:52,780
The station at Allahabad was reached about ten o'clock, and, the interrupted line of railway being resumed, would enable them to reach Calcutta in less than twenty-four hours.

1214
02:13:53,460 --> 02:14:01,719
Phileas Fogg would thus be able to arrive in time to take the steamer which left Calcutta the next day, October 25th, at noon, for Hong Kong.

1215
02:14:02,679 --> 02:14:16,600
The young woman was placed in one of the waiting-rooms of the station, whilst Passepartout was charged with purchasing for her various articles of toilet, a dress, shawl, and some furs; for which his master gave him unlimited credit.

1216
02:14:17,440 --> 02:14:35,300
Passepartout started off forthwith, and found himself in the streets of Allahabad, that is, the City of God, one of the most venerated in India, being built at the junction of the two sacred rivers, Ganges and Jumna, the waters of which attract pilgrims from every part of the peninsula.

1217
02:14:36,120 --> 02:14:44,980
The Ganges, according to the legends of the Ramayana, rises in heaven, whence, owing to Brahma's agency, it descends to the earth.

1218
02:14:45,699 --> 02:14:50,399
Passepartout made it a point, as he made his purchases, to take a good look at the city.

1219
02:14:50,960 --> 02:15:04,360
It was formerly defended by a noble fort, which has since become a state prison; its commerce has dwindled away, and Passepartout in vain looked about him for such a bazaar as he used to frequent in Regent Street.

1220
02:15:04,939 --> 02:15:20,420
At last he came upon an elderly, crusty Jew, who sold second-hand articles, and from whom he purchased a dress of Scotch stuff, a large mantle, and a fine otter-skin pelisse, for which he did not hesitate to pay seventy-five pounds.

1221
02:15:20,560 --> 02:15:23,340
He then returned triumphantly to the station.

1222
02:15:24,540 --> 02:15:36,640
The influence to which the priests of Pillaji had subjected Aouda began gradually to yield, and she became more herself, so that her fine eyes resumed all their soft Indian expression.

1223
02:15:37,579 --> 02:15:44,420
When the poet-king, Ucaf Uddaul, celebrates the charms of the queen of Ahmehnagara, he speaks thus:

1224
02:15:45,100 --> 02:15:54,420
"Her shining tresses, divided in two parts, encircle the harmonious contour of her white and delicate cheeks, brilliant in their glow and freshness.

1225
02:15:54,880 --> 02:16:11,280
Her ebony brows have the form and charm of the bow of Kama, the god of love, and beneath her long silken lashes the purest reflections and a celestial light swim, as in the sacred lakes of Himalaya, in the black pupils of her great clear eyes.

1226
02:16:11,739 --> 02:16:19,900
Her teeth, fine, equal, and white, glitter between her smiling lips like dewdrops in a passion-flower's half-enveloped breast.

1227
02:16:20,580 --> 02:16:33,620
Her delicately formed ears, her vermilion hands, her little feet, curved and tender as the lotus-bud, glitter with the brilliancy of the loveliest pearls of Ceylon, the most dazzling diamonds of Golconda.

1228
02:16:34,160 --> 02:16:56,520
Her narrow and supple waist, which a hand may clasp around, sets forth the outline of her rounded figure and the beauty of her bosom, where youth in its flower displays the wealth of its treasures; and beneath the silken folds of her tunic she seems to have been modelled in pure silver by the godlike hand of Vicvarcarma, the immortal sculptor."

1229
02:16:57,680 --> 02:17:07,280
It is enough to say, without applying this poetical rhapsody to Aouda, that she was a charming woman, in all the European acceptation of the phrase.

1230
02:17:07,600 --> 02:17:15,980
She spoke English with great purity, and the guide had not exaggerated in saying that the young Parsee had been transformed by her bringing up.

1231
02:17:16,940 --> 02:17:31,100
The train was about to start from Allahabad, and Mr. Fogg proceeded to pay the guide the price agreed upon for his service, and not a farthing more; which astonished Passepartout, who remembered all that his master owed to the guide's devotion.

1232
02:17:31,520 --> 02:17:39,980
He had, indeed, risked his life in the adventure at Pillaji, and, if he should be caught afterwards by the Indians, he would with difficulty escape their vengeance.

1233
02:17:40,740 --> 02:17:43,240
Kiouni, also, must be disposed of.

1234
02:17:43,760 --> 02:17:47,080
What should be done with the elephant, which had been so dearly purchased?

1235
02:17:47,680 --> 02:17:50,239
Phileas Fogg had already determined this question.

1236
02:17:50,920 --> 02:17:55,660
"Parsee," said he to the guide, "you have been serviceable and devoted.

1237
02:17:55,681 --> 02:17:59,101
I have paid for your service, but not for your devotion.

1238
02:17:59,680 --> 02:18:01,379
Would you like to have this elephant?

1239
02:18:01,719 --> 02:18:02,540
He is yours."

1240
02:18:03,240 --> 02:18:04,641
The guide's eyes glistened.

1241
02:18:05,500 --> 02:18:07,420
"Your honour is giving me a fortune!"

1242
02:18:07,740 --> 02:18:08,219
cried he.

1243
02:18:08,879 --> 02:18:13,340
"Take him, guide," returned Mr. Fogg, "and I shall still be your debtor."

1244
02:18:14,160 --> 02:18:14,959
"Good!"

1245
02:18:14,979 --> 02:18:16,080
exclaimed Passepartout.

1246
02:18:16,500 --> 02:18:17,200
"Take him, friend.

1247
02:18:17,540 --> 02:18:19,540
Kiouni is a brave and faithful beast."

1248
02:18:20,139 --> 02:18:25,879
And, going up to the elephant, he gave him several lumps of sugar, saying, "Here, Kiouni, here, here."

1249
02:18:26,500 --> 02:18:33,540
The elephant grunted out his satisfaction, and, clasping Passepartout around the waist with his trunk, lifted him as high as his head.

1250
02:18:34,318 --> 02:18:40,061
Passepartout, not in the least alarmed, caressed the animal, which replaced him gently on the ground.

1251
02:18:41,139 --> 02:18:51,400
Soon after, Phileas Fogg, Sir Francis Cromarty, and Passepartout, installed in a carriage with Aouda, who had the best seat, were whirling at full speed towards Benares.

1252
02:18:52,240 --> 02:18:55,820
It was a run of eighty miles, and was accomplished in two hours.

1253
02:18:56,420 --> 02:18:59,700
During the journey, the young woman fully recovered her senses.

1254
02:19:00,440 --> 02:19:09,020
What was her astonishment to find herself in this carriage, on the railway, dressed in European habiliments, and with travellers who were quite strangers to her!

1255
02:19:09,719 --> 02:19:28,780
Her companions first set about fully reviving her with a little liquor, and then Sir Francis narrated to her what had passed, dwelling upon the courage with which Phileas Fogg had not hesitated to risk his life to save her, and recounting the happy sequel of the venture, the result of Passepartout's rash idea.

1256
02:19:29,459 --> 02:19:35,260
Mr. Fogg said nothing; while Passepartout, abashed, kept repeating that "it wasn't worth telling."

1257
02:19:36,101 --> 02:19:44,920
Aouda pathetically thanked her deliverers, rather with tears than words; her fine eyes interpreted her gratitude better than her lips.

1258
02:19:45,398 --> 02:19:53,020
Then, as her thoughts strayed back to the scene of the sacrifice, and recalled the dangers which still menaced her, she shuddered with terror.

1259
02:19:53,600 --> 02:20:07,840
Phileas Fogg understood what was passing in Aouda's mind, and offered, in order to reassure her, to escort her to Hong Kong, where she might remain safely until the affair was hushed up--an offer which she eagerly and gratefully accepted.

1260
02:20:08,620 --> 02:20:18,420
She had, it seems, a Parsee relation, who was one of the principal merchants of Hong Kong, which is wholly an English city, though on an island on the Chinese coast.

1261
02:20:19,420 --> 02:20:22,280
At half-past twelve the train stopped at Benares.

1262
02:20:22,740 --> 02:20:49,380
The Brahmin legends assert that this city is built on the site of the ancient Casi, which, like Mahomet's tomb, was once suspended between heaven and earth; though the Benares of to-day, which the Orientalists call the Athens of India, stands quite unpoetically on the solid earth, Passepartout caught glimpses of its brick houses and clay huts, giving an aspect of desolation to the place, as the train entered it.

1263
02:20:50,261 --> 02:20:58,120
Benares was Sir Francis Cromarty's destination, the troops he was rejoining being encamped some miles northward of the city.

1264
02:20:58,980 --> 02:21:08,940
He bade adieu to Phileas Fogg, wishing him all success, and expressing the hope that he would come that way again in a less original but more profitable fashion.

1265
02:21:09,660 --> 02:21:11,780
Mr. Fogg lightly pressed him by the hand.

1266
02:21:11,820 --> 02:21:22,660
The parting of Aouda, who did not forget what she owed to Sir Francis, betrayed more warmth; and, as for Passepartout, he received a hearty shake of the hand from the gallant general.

1267
02:21:22,680 --> 02:21:28,860
The railway, on leaving Benares, passed for a while along the valley of the Ganges.

1268
02:21:29,320 --> 02:21:47,000
Through the windows of their carriage the travellers had glimpses of the diversified landscape of Behar, with its mountains clothed in verdure, its fields of barley, wheat, and corn, its jungles peopled with green alligators, its neat villages, and its still thickly-leaved forests.

1269
02:21:47,560 --> 02:21:58,380
Elephants were bathing in the waters of the sacred river, and groups of Indians, despite the advanced season and chilly air, were performing solemnly their pious ablutions.

1270
02:21:59,199 --> 02:22:13,080
These were fervent Brahmins, the bitterest foes of Buddhism, their deities being Vishnu, the solar god, Shiva, the divine impersonation of natural forces, and Brahma, the supreme ruler of priests and legislators.

1271
02:22:14,080 --> 02:22:30,120
What would these divinities think of India, anglicised as it is to-day, with steamers whistling and scudding along the Ganges, frightening the gulls which float upon its surface, the turtles swarming along its banks, and the faithful dwelling upon its borders?

1272
02:22:31,061 --> 02:23:18,780
The panorama passed before their eyes like a flash, save when the steam concealed it fitfully from the view; the travellers could scarcely discern the fort of Chupenie, twenty miles south-westward from Benares, the ancient stronghold of the rajahs of Behar; or Ghazipur and its famous rose-water factories; or the tomb of Lord Cornwallis, rising on the left bank of the Ganges; the fortified town of Buxar, or Patna, a large manufacturing and trading-place, where is held the principal opium market of India; or Monghir, a more than European town, for it is as English as Manchester or Birmingham, with its iron foundries, edgetool factories, and high chimneys puffing clouds of black smoke heavenward.

1273
02:23:20,000 --> 02:23:45,780
Night came on; the train passed on at full speed, in the midst of the roaring of the tigers, bears, and wolves which fled before the locomotive; and the marvels of Bengal, Golconda ruined Gour, Murshedabad, the ancient capital, Burdwan, Hugly, and the French town of Chandernagor, where Passepartout would have been proud to see his country's flag flying, were hidden from their view in the darkness.

1274
02:23:46,460 --> 02:23:54,940
Calcutta was reached at seven in the morning, and the packet left for Hong Kong at noon; so that Phileas Fogg had five hours before him.

1275
02:23:55,980 --> 02:24:04,240
According to his journal, he was due at Calcutta on the 25th of October, and that was the exact date of his actual arrival.

1276
02:24:05,000 --> 02:24:08,260
He was therefore neither behind-hand nor ahead of time.

1277
02:24:08,899 --> 02:24:15,820
The two days gained between London and Bombay had been lost, as has been seen, in the journey across India.

1278
02:24:16,600 --> 02:24:20,080
But it is not to be supposed that Phileas Fogg regretted them.

1279
02:24:21,070 --> 02:24:24,479

Around the World in Eighty Days

1283
02:24:42,740 --> 02:24:45,960
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

1284
02:24:45,960 --> 02:24:47,990
Chapter 15

1285
02:24:47,990 --> 02:24:53,510
IN WHICH THE BAG OF BANKNOTES DISGORGES SOME THOUSANDS OF POUNDS MORE

1286
02:24:54,280 --> 02:25:03,000
The train entered the station, and Passepartout jumping out first, was followed by Mr. Fogg, who assisted his fair companion to descend.

1287
02:25:03,740 --> 02:25:11,320
Phileas Fogg intended to proceed at once to the Hong Kong steamer, in order to get Aouda comfortably settled for the voyage.

1288
02:25:12,140 --> 02:25:15,500
He was unwilling to leave her while they were still on dangerous ground.

1289
02:25:16,580 --> 02:25:21,880
Just as he was leaving the station a policeman came up to him, and said, "Mr. Phileas Fogg?"

1290
02:25:22,380 --> 02:25:22,980
"I am he."

1291
02:25:23,620 --> 02:25:25,181
"Is this man your servant?"

1292
02:25:25,200 --> 02:25:27,660
added the policeman, pointing to Passepartout.

1293
02:25:28,160 --> 02:25:28,740
"Yes."

1294
02:25:29,561 --> 02:25:31,620
"Be so good, both of you, as to follow me."

1295
02:25:32,440 --> 02:25:34,840
Mr. Fogg betrayed no surprise whatever.

1296
02:25:35,439 --> 02:25:40,520
The policeman was a representative of the law, and law is sacred to an Englishman.

1297
02:25:41,279 --> 02:25:48,760
Passepartout tried to reason about the matter, but the policeman tapped him with his stick, and Mr. Fogg made him a signal to obey.

1298
02:25:49,560 --> 02:25:51,439
"May this young lady go with us?"

1299
02:25:51,660 --> 02:25:52,200
asked he.

1300
02:25:52,820 --> 02:25:54,780
"She may," replied the policeman.

1301
02:25:55,620 --> 02:26:06,699
Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout were conducted to a palkigahri, a sort of four-wheeled carriage, drawn by two horses, in which they took their places and were driven away.

1302
02:26:07,680 --> 02:26:12,160
No one spoke during the twenty minutes which elapsed before they reached their destination.

1303
02:26:12,880 --> 02:26:36,340
They first passed through the "black town," with its narrow streets, its miserable, dirty huts, and squalid population; then through the "European town," which presented a relief in its bright brick mansions, shaded by coconut-trees and bristling with masts, where, although it was early morning, elegantly dressed horsemen and handsome equipages were passing back and forth.

1304
02:26:37,200 --> 02:26:42,920
The carriage stopped before a modest-looking house, which, however, did not have the appearance of a private mansion.

1305
02:26:43,740 --> 02:26:57,040
The policeman having requested his prisoners--for so, truly, they might be called--to descend, conducted them into a room with barred windows, and said:  "You will appear before Judge Obadiah at half-past eight."

1306
02:26:57,480 --> 02:26:59,359
He then retired, and closed the door.

1307
02:27:00,221 --> 02:27:01,681
"Why, we are prisoners!"

1308
02:27:01,700 --> 02:27:05,000
exclaimed Passepartout, falling into a chair.

1309
02:27:05,040 --> 02:27:11,240
Aouda, with an emotion she tried to conceal, said to Mr. Fogg: "Sir, you must leave me to my fate!

1310
02:27:11,720 --> 02:27:16,480
It is on my account that you receive this treatment, it is for having saved me!"

1311
02:27:17,320 --> 02:27:20,780
Phileas Fogg contented himself with saying that it was impossible.

1312
02:27:21,460 --> 02:27:25,460
It was quite unlikely that he should be arrested for preventing a suttee.

1313
02:27:25,920 --> 02:27:29,580
The complainants would not dare present themselves with such a charge.

1314
02:27:30,100 --> 02:27:31,260
There was some mistake.

1315
02:27:31,880 --> 02:27:37,561
Moreover, he would not, in any event, abandon Aouda, but would escort her to Hong Kong.

1316
02:27:38,399 --> 02:27:40,340
"But the steamer leaves at noon!"

1317
02:27:40,740 --> 02:27:42,380
observed Passepartout, nervously.

1318
02:27:43,080 --> 02:27:47,100
"We shall be on board by noon," replied his master, placidly.

1319
02:27:47,760 --> 02:27:53,940
It was said so positively that Passepartout could not help muttering to himself, "Parbleu that's certain!

1320
02:27:54,560 --> 02:27:56,560
Before noon we shall be on board."

1321
02:27:57,300 --> 02:27:59,180
But he was by no means reassured.

1322
02:28:00,640 --> 02:28:08,380
At half-past eight the door opened, the policeman appeared, and, requesting them to follow him, led the way to an adjoining hall.

1323
02:28:09,061 --> 02:28:15,520
It was evidently a court-room, and a crowd of Europeans and natives already occupied the rear of the apartment.

1324
02:28:16,320 --> 02:28:22,860
Mr. Fogg and his two companions took their places on a bench opposite the desks of the magistrate and his clerk.

1325
02:28:23,561 --> 02:28:28,740
Immediately after, Judge Obadiah, a fat, round man, followed by the clerk, entered.

1326
02:28:29,600 --> 02:28:34,440
He proceeded to take down a wig which was hanging on a nail, and put it hurriedly on his head.

1327
02:28:35,500 --> 02:28:37,120
"The first case," said he.

1328
02:28:37,960 --> 02:28:41,080
Then, putting his hand to his head, he exclaimed, "Heh!

1329
02:28:41,420 --> 02:28:42,740
This is not my wig!"

1330
02:28:43,340 --> 02:28:46,060
"No, your worship," returned the clerk, "it is mine."

1331
02:28:46,680 --> 02:28:51,440
"My dear Mr. Oysterpuff, how can a judge give a wise sentence in a clerk's wig?"

1332
02:28:51,540 --> 02:28:53,560
The wigs were exchanged.

1333
02:28:54,340 --> 02:29:01,700
Passepartout was getting nervous, for the hands on the face of the big clock over the judge seemed to go around with terrible rapidity.

1334
02:29:02,660 --> 02:29:05,220
"The first case," repeated Judge Obadiah.

1335
02:29:05,899 --> 02:29:06,761
"Phileas Fogg?"

1336
02:29:07,300 --> 02:29:08,460
demanded Oysterpuff.

1337
02:29:08,979 --> 02:29:10,740
"I am here," replied Mr. Fogg.

1338
02:29:11,380 --> 02:29:12,220
"Passepartout?"

1339
02:29:12,801 --> 02:29:14,840
"Present," responded Passepartout.

1340
02:29:15,460 --> 02:29:16,840
"Good," said the judge.

1341
02:29:17,520 --> 02:29:22,020
"You have been looked for, prisoners, for two days on the trains from Bombay."

1342
02:29:22,680 --> 02:29:24,760
"But of what are we accused?"

1343
02:29:24,779 --> 02:29:26,460
asked Passepartout, impatiently.

1344
02:29:27,020 --> 02:29:28,860
"You are about to be informed."

1345
02:29:29,480 --> 02:29:33,660
"I am an English subject, sir," said Mr. Fogg, "and I have the right--"

1346
02:29:34,020 --> 02:29:35,420
"Have you been ill-treated?"

1347
02:29:36,061 --> 02:29:36,840
"Not at all."

1348
02:29:37,301 --> 02:29:39,319
"Very well; let the complainants come in."

1349
02:29:40,279 --> 02:29:44,520
A door was swung open by order of the judge, and three Indian priests entered.

1350
02:29:45,120 --> 02:29:50,620
"That's it," muttered Passepartout; "these are the rogues who were going to burn our young lady."

1351
02:29:51,580 --> 02:30:06,939
The priests took their places in front of the judge, and the clerk proceeded to read in a loud voice a complaint of sacrilege against Phileas Fogg and his servant, who were accused of having violated a place held consecrated by the Brahmin religion.

1352
02:30:06,979 --> 02:30:08,260
"You hear the charge?"

1353
02:30:08,500 --> 02:30:09,340
asked the judge.

1354
02:30:10,140 --> 02:30:14,240
"Yes, sir," replied Mr. Fogg, consulting his watch, "and I admit it."

1355
02:30:14,939 --> 02:30:15,601
"You admit it?"

1356
02:30:16,120 --> 02:30:24,380
"I admit it, and I wish to hear these priests admit, in their turn, what they were going to do at the pagoda of Pillaji."

1357
02:30:24,480 --> 02:30:28,380
The priests looked at each other; they did not seem to understand what was said.

1358
02:30:28,940 --> 02:30:35,580
"Yes," cried Passepartout, warmly; "at the pagoda of Pillaji, where they were on the point of burning their victim."

1359
02:30:36,420 --> 02:30:40,180
The judge stared with astonishment, and the priests were stupefied.

1360
02:30:40,860 --> 02:30:41,620
"What victim?"

1361
02:30:41,899 --> 02:30:42,960
said Judge Obadiah.

1362
02:30:43,340 --> 02:30:44,279
"Burn whom?

1363
02:30:44,300 --> 02:30:45,880
In Bombay itself?"

1364
02:30:46,260 --> 02:30:46,880
"Bombay?"

1365
02:30:47,180 --> 02:30:48,061
cried Passepartout.

1366
02:30:48,740 --> 02:30:49,480
"Certainly.

1367
02:30:49,740 --> 02:30:55,400
We are not talking of the pagoda of Pillaji, but of the pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay."

1368
02:30:56,120 --> 02:31:01,880
"And as a proof," added the clerk, "here are the desecrator's very shoes, which he left behind him."

1369
02:31:02,340 --> 02:31:04,820
Whereupon he placed a pair of shoes on his desk.

1370
02:31:05,280 --> 02:31:06,140
"My shoes!"

1371
02:31:06,340 --> 02:31:11,160
cried Passepartout, in his surprise permitting this imprudent exclamation to escape him.

1372
02:31:12,120 --> 02:31:20,061
The confusion of master and man, who had quite forgotten the affair at Bombay, for which they were now detained at Calcutta, may be imagined.

1373
02:31:20,980 --> 02:31:31,140
Fix the detective, had foreseen the advantage which Passepartout's escapade gave him, and, delaying his departure for twelve hours, had consulted the priests of Malabar Hill.

1374
02:31:31,880 --> 02:31:42,660
Knowing that the English authorities dealt very severely with this kind of misdemeanour, he promised them a goodly sum in damages, and sent them forward to Calcutta by the next train.

1375
02:31:43,720 --> 02:31:56,720
Owing to the delay caused by the rescue of the young widow, Fix and the priests reached the Indian capital before Mr. Fogg and his servant, the magistrates having been already warned by a dispatch to arrest them should they arrive.

1376
02:31:57,520 --> 02:32:03,700
Fix's disappointment when he learned that Phileas Fogg had not made his appearance in Calcutta may be imagined.

1377
02:32:04,480 --> 02:32:10,700
He made up his mind that the robber had stopped somewhere on the route and taken refuge in the southern provinces.

1378
02:32:11,721 --> 02:32:26,160
For twenty-four hours Fix watched the station with feverish anxiety; at last he was rewarded by seeing Mr. Fogg and Passepartout arrive, accompanied by a young woman, whose presence he was wholly at a loss to explain.

1379
02:32:27,060 --> 02:32:33,540
He hastened for a policeman; and this was how the party came to be arrested and brought before Judge Obadiah.

1380
02:32:34,520 --> 02:32:50,620
Had Passepartout been a little less preoccupied, he would have espied the detective ensconced in a corner of the court-room, watching the proceedings with an interest easily understood; for the warrant had failed to reach him at Calcutta, as it had done at Bombay and Suez.

1381
02:32:51,620 --> 02:32:59,180
Judge Obadiah had unfortunately caught Passepartout's rash exclamation, which the poor fellow would have given the world to recall.

1382
02:33:00,100 --> 02:33:01,440
"The facts are admitted?"

1383
02:33:01,720 --> 02:33:02,641
asked the judge.

1384
02:33:03,220 --> 02:33:05,840
"Admitted," replied Mr. Fogg, coldly.

1385
02:33:06,540 --> 02:33:29,840
"Inasmuch," resumed the judge, "as the English law protects equally and sternly the religions of the Indian people, and as the man Passepartout has admitted that he violated the sacred pagoda of Malabar Hill, at Bombay, on the 20th of October, I condemn the said Passepartout to imprisonment for fifteen days and a fine of three hundred pounds."

1386
02:33:30,359 --> 02:33:31,960
"Three hundred pounds!"

1387
02:33:32,060 --> 02:33:35,240
cried Passepartout, startled at the largeness of the sum.

1388
02:33:35,740 --> 02:33:36,540
"Silence!"

1389
02:33:36,760 --> 02:33:37,880
shouted the constable.

1390
02:33:38,440 --> 02:33:58,601
"And inasmuch," continued the judge, "as it is not proved that the act was not done by the connivance of the master with the servant, and as the master in any case must be held responsible for the acts of his paid servant, I condemn Phileas Fogg to a week's imprisonment and a fine of one hundred and fifty pounds."

1391
02:33:59,360 --> 02:34:09,761
Fix rubbed his hands softly with satisfaction; if Phileas Fogg could be detained in Calcutta a week, it would be more than time for the warrant to arrive.

1392
02:34:10,400 --> 02:34:12,160
Passepartout was stupefied.

1393
02:34:12,760 --> 02:34:14,620
This sentence ruined his master.

1394
02:34:15,101 --> 02:34:22,420
A wager of twenty thousand pounds lost, because he, like a precious fool, had gone into that abominable pagoda!

1395
02:34:23,180 --> 02:34:31,520
Phileas Fogg, as self-composed as if the judgment did not in the least concern him, did not even lift his eyebrows while it was being pronounced.

1396
02:34:32,180 --> 02:34:37,181
Just as the clerk was calling the next case, he rose, and said, "I offer bail."

1397
02:34:37,780 --> 02:34:40,180
"You have that right," returned the judge.

1398
02:34:40,780 --> 02:34:50,120
Fix's blood ran cold, but he resumed his composure when he heard the judge announce that the bail required for each prisoner would be one thousand pounds.

1399
02:34:50,780 --> 02:35:00,500
"I will pay it at once," said Mr. Fogg, taking a roll of bank-bills from the carpet-bag, which Passepartout had by him, and placing them on the clerk's desk.

1400
02:35:01,420 --> 02:35:06,100
"This sum will be restored to you upon your release from prison," said the judge.

1401
02:35:06,540 --> 02:35:09,000
"Meanwhile, you are liberated on bail."

1402
02:35:09,780 --> 02:35:10,101
"Come!"

1403
02:35:10,420 --> 02:35:12,020
said Phileas Fogg to his servant.

1404
02:35:12,500 --> 02:35:15,000
"But let them at least give me back my shoes!"

1405
02:35:15,280 --> 02:35:16,640
cried Passepartout angrily.

1406
02:35:17,380 --> 02:35:19,640
"Ah, these are pretty dear shoes!"

1407
02:35:19,920 --> 02:35:21,561
he muttered, as they were handed to him.

1408
02:35:21,940 --> 02:35:26,320
"More than a thousand pounds apiece; besides, they pinch my feet."

1409
02:35:27,400 --> 02:35:33,141
Mr. Fogg, offering his arm to Aouda, then departed, followed by the crestfallen Passepartout.

1410
02:35:33,979 --> 02:35:44,580
Fix still nourished hopes that the robber would not, after all, leave the two thousand pounds behind him, but would decide to serve out his week in jail, and issued forth on Mr. Fogg's traces.

1411
02:35:45,061 --> 02:35:49,700
That gentleman took a carriage, and the party were soon landed on one of the quays.

1412
02:35:50,601 --> 02:35:56,920
The Rangoon was moored half a mile off in the harbour, its signal of departure hoisted at the mast-head.

1413
02:35:57,460 --> 02:36:02,240
Eleven o'clock was striking; Mr. Fogg was an hour in advance of time.

1414
02:36:03,000 --> 02:36:09,460
Fix saw them leave the carriage and push off in a boat for the steamer, and stamped his feet with disappointment.

1415
02:36:09,940 --> 02:36:11,680
"The rascal is off, after all!"

1416
02:36:11,860 --> 02:36:12,641
he exclaimed.

1417
02:36:13,000 --> 02:36:14,760
"Two thousand pounds sacrificed!

1418
02:36:14,939 --> 02:36:16,500
He's as prodigal as a thief!

1419
02:36:17,000 --> 02:36:24,140
I'll follow him to the end of the world if necessary; but, at the rate he is going on, the stolen money will soon be exhausted."

1420
02:36:24,820 --> 02:36:28,120
The detective was not far wrong in making this conjecture.

1421
02:36:28,700 --> 02:36:47,061
Since leaving London, what with travelling expenses, bribes, the purchase of the elephant, bails, and fines, Mr. Fogg had already spent more than five thousand pounds on the way, and the percentage of the sum recovered from the bank robber promised to the detectives, was rapidly diminishing.

Chapter 16

1428
02:37:14,721 --> 02:37:19,870
IN WHICH FIX DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND IN THE LEAST WHAT IS SAID TO HIM

1429
02:37:20,620 --> 02:37:35,439
The Rangoon--one of the Peninsular and Oriental Company's boats plying in the Chinese and Japanese seas--was a screw steamer, built of iron, weighing about seventeen hundred and seventy tons, and with engines of four hundred horse-power.

1430
02:37:36,020 --> 02:37:45,800
She was as fast, but not as well fitted up, as the Mongolia, and Aouda was not as comfortably provided for on board of her as Phileas Fogg could have wished.

1431
02:37:46,660 --> 02:37:58,200
However, the trip from Calcutta to Hong Kong only comprised some three thousand five hundred miles, occupying from ten to twelve days, and the young woman was not difficult to please.

1432
02:37:59,160 --> 02:38:08,240
During the first days of the journey Aouda became better acquainted with her protector, and constantly gave evidence of her deep gratitude for what he had done.

1433
02:38:09,061 --> 02:38:22,780
The phlegmatic gentleman listened to her, apparently at least, with coldness, neither his voice nor his manner betraying the slightest emotion; but he seemed to be always on the watch that nothing should be wanting to Aouda's comfort.

1434
02:38:23,601 --> 02:38:30,920
He visited her regularly each day at certain hours, not so much to talk himself, as to sit and hear her talk.

1435
02:38:31,680 --> 02:38:40,300
He treated her with the strictest politeness, but with the precision of an automaton, the movements of which had been arranged for this purpose.

1436
02:38:40,320 --> 02:38:51,620
Aouda did not quite know what to make of him, though Passepartout had given her some hints of his master's eccentricity, and made her smile by telling her of the wager which was sending him round the world.

1437
02:38:52,360 --> 02:38:59,060
After all, she owed Phileas Fogg her life, and she always regarded him through the exalting medium of her gratitude.

1438
02:39:00,040 --> 02:39:04,020
Aouda confirmed the Parsee guide's narrative of her touching history.

1439
02:39:04,399 --> 02:39:08,181
She did, indeed, belong to the highest of the native races of India.

1440
02:39:08,940 --> 02:39:18,960
Many of the Parsee merchants have made great fortunes there by dealing in cotton; and one of them, Sir Jametsee Jeejeebhoy, was made a baronet by the English government.

1441
02:39:19,439 --> 02:39:26,740
Aouda was a relative of this great man, and it was his cousin, Jeejeeh, whom she hoped to join at Hong Kong.

1442
02:39:27,260 --> 02:39:40,000
Whether she would find a protector in him she could not tell; but Mr. Fogg essayed to calm her anxieties, and to assure her that everything would be mathematically--he used the very word--arranged.

1443
02:39:40,480 --> 02:39:52,340
Aouda fastened her great eyes, "clear as the sacred lakes of the Himalaya," upon him; but the intractable Fogg, as reserved as ever, did not seem at all inclined to throw himself into this lake.

1444
02:39:53,320 --> 02:40:11,520
The first few days of the voyage passed prosperously, amid favourable weather and propitious winds, and they soon came in sight of the great Andaman, the principal of the islands in the Bay of Bengal, with its picturesque Saddle Peak, two thousand four hundred feet high, looming above the waters.

1445
02:40:12,200 --> 02:40:23,061
The steamer passed along near the shores, but the savage Papuans, who are in the lowest scale of humanity, but are not, as has been asserted, cannibals, did not make their appearance.

1446
02:40:24,120 --> 02:40:27,900
The panorama of the islands, as they steamed by them, was superb.

1447
02:40:28,520 --> 02:40:52,520
Vast forests of palms, arecs, bamboo, teakwood, of the gigantic mimosa, and tree-like ferns covered the foreground, while behind, the graceful outlines of the mountains were traced against the sky; and along the coasts swarmed by thousands the precious swallows whose nests furnish a luxurious dish to the tables of the Celestial Empire.

1448
02:40:53,220 --> 02:41:04,500
The varied landscape afforded by the Andaman Islands was soon passed, however, and the Rangoon rapidly approached the Straits of Malacca, which gave access to the China seas.

1449
02:41:05,480 --> 02:41:11,760
What was detective Fix, so unluckily drawn on from country to country, doing all this while?

1450
02:41:12,479 --> 02:41:29,080
He had managed to embark on the Rangoon at Calcutta without being seen by Passepartout, after leaving orders that, if the warrant should arrive, it should be forwarded to him at Hong Kong; and he hoped to conceal his presence to the end of the voyage.

1451
02:41:29,100 --> 02:41:36,680
It would have been difficult to explain why he was on board without awakening Passepartout's suspicions, who thought him still at Bombay.

1452
02:41:37,439 --> 02:41:43,800
But necessity impelled him, nevertheless, to renew his acquaintance with the worthy servant, as will be seen.

1453
02:41:44,920 --> 02:41:54,060
All the detective's hopes and wishes were now centred on Hong Kong; for the steamer's stay at Singapore would be too brief to enable him to take any steps there.

1454
02:41:54,580 --> 02:41:59,561
The arrest must be made at Hong Kong, or the robber would probably escape him for ever.

1455
02:42:00,080 --> 02:42:09,840
Hong Kong was the last English ground on which he would set foot; beyond, China, Japan, America offered to Fogg an almost certain refuge.

1456
02:42:10,220 --> 02:42:19,120
If the warrant should at last make its appearance at Hong Kong, Fix could arrest him and give him into the hands of the local police, and there would be no further trouble.

1457
02:42:19,460 --> 02:42:32,600
But beyond Hong Kong, a simple warrant would be of no avail; an extradition warrant would be necessary, and that would result in delays and obstacles, of which the rascal would take advantage to elude justice.

1458
02:42:33,260 --> 02:42:51,940
Fix thought over these probabilities during the long hours which he spent in his cabin, and kept repeating to himself, "Now, either the warrant will be at Hong Kong, in which case I shall arrest my man, or it will not be there; and this time it is absolutely necessary that I should delay his departure.

1459
02:42:51,960 --> 02:43:02,000
I have failed at Bombay, and I have failed at Calcutta; if I fail at Hong Kong, my reputation is lost:  Cost what it may, I must succeed!

1460
02:43:02,260 --> 02:43:06,780
But how shall I prevent his departure, if that should turn out to be my last resource?"

1461
02:43:07,500 --> 02:43:15,779
Fix made up his mind that, if worst came to worst, he would make a confidant of Passepartout, and tell him what kind of a fellow his master really was.

1462
02:43:16,400 --> 02:43:20,101
That Passepartout was not Fogg's accomplice, he was very certain.

1463
02:43:20,660 --> 02:43:29,200
The servant, enlightened by his disclosure, and afraid of being himself implicated in the crime, would doubtless become an ally of the detective.

1464
02:43:29,700 --> 02:43:35,380
But this method was a dangerous one, only to be employed when everything else had failed.

1465
02:43:35,500 --> 02:43:38,540
A word from Passepartout to his master would ruin all.

1466
02:43:39,080 --> 02:43:41,460
The detective was therefore in a sore strait.

1467
02:43:42,260 --> 02:43:44,240
But suddenly a new idea struck him.

1468
02:43:44,820 --> 02:43:51,500
The presence of Aouda on the Rangoon, in company with Phileas Fogg, gave him new material for reflection.

1469
02:43:52,200 --> 02:43:53,340
Who was this woman?

1470
02:43:53,820 --> 02:43:57,360
What combination of events had made her Fogg's travelling companion?

1471
02:43:57,900 --> 02:44:02,700
They had evidently met somewhere between Bombay and Calcutta; but where?

1472
02:44:03,160 --> 02:44:09,180
Had they met accidentally, or had Fogg gone into the interior purposely in quest of this charming damsel?

1473
02:44:09,880 --> 02:44:11,819
Fix was fairly puzzled.

1474
02:44:12,060 --> 02:44:22,120
He asked himself whether there had not been a wicked elopement; and this idea so impressed itself upon his mind that he determined to make use of the supposed intrigue.

1475
02:44:22,740 --> 02:44:32,280
Whether the young woman were married or not, he would be able to create such difficulties for Mr. Fogg at Hong Kong that he could not escape by paying any amount of money.

1476
02:44:33,120 --> 02:44:35,540
But could he even wait till they reached Hong Kong?

1477
02:44:36,060 --> 02:44:45,020
Fogg had an abominable way of jumping from one boat to another, and, before anything could be effected, might get full under way again for Yokohama.

1478
02:44:45,700 --> 02:44:51,500
Fix decided that he must warn the English authorities, and signal the Rangoon before her arrival.

1479
02:44:52,080 --> 02:44:58,520
This was easy to do, since the steamer stopped at Singapore, whence there is a telegraphic wire to Hong Kong.

1480
02:44:59,300 --> 02:45:04,700
He finally resolved, moreover, before acting more positively, to question Passepartout.

1481
02:45:04,720 --> 02:45:11,120
It would not be difficult to make him talk; and, as there was no time to lose, Fix prepared to make himself known.

1482
02:45:12,180 --> 02:45:18,300
It was now the 30th of October, and on the following day the Rangoon was due at Singapore.

1483
02:45:19,240 --> 02:45:21,720
Fix emerged from his cabin and went on deck.

1484
02:45:22,140 --> 02:45:26,420
Passepartout was promenading up and down in the forward part of the steamer.

1485
02:45:26,820 --> 02:45:34,160
The detective rushed forward with every appearance of extreme surprise, and exclaimed, "You here, on the Rangoon?"

1486
02:45:34,780 --> 02:45:37,061
"What, Monsieur Fix, are you on board?"

1487
02:45:37,439 --> 02:45:42,280
returned the really astonished Passepartout, recognising his crony of the Mongolia.

1488
02:45:42,780 --> 02:45:47,280
"Why, I left you at Bombay, and here you are, on the way to Hong Kong!

1489
02:45:47,300 --> 02:45:48,900
Are you going round the world too?"

1490
02:45:49,820 --> 02:45:54,480
"No, no," replied Fix; "I shall stop at Hong Kong--at least for some days."

1491
02:45:54,980 --> 02:45:55,380
"Hum!"

1492
02:45:55,740 --> 02:45:58,620
said Passepartout, who seemed for an instant perplexed.

1493
02:45:59,101 --> 02:46:02,800
"But how is it I have not seen you on board since we left Calcutta?"

1494
02:46:03,360 --> 02:46:06,780
"Oh, a trifle of sea-sickness--I've been staying in my berth.

1495
02:46:07,260 --> 02:46:11,681
The Gulf of Bengal does not agree with me as well as the Indian Ocean.

1496
02:46:11,700 --> 02:46:12,960
And how is Mr. Fogg?"

1497
02:46:13,580 --> 02:46:17,399
"As well and as punctual as ever, not a day behind time!

1498
02:46:17,859 --> 02:46:21,160
But, Monsieur Fix, you don't know that we have a young lady with us."

1499
02:46:21,979 --> 02:46:23,000
"A young lady?"

1500
02:46:23,220 --> 02:46:26,520
replied the detective, not seeming to comprehend what was said.

1501
02:46:27,240 --> 02:46:43,400
Passepartout thereupon recounted Aouda's history, the affair at the Bombay pagoda, the purchase of the elephant for two thousand pounds, the rescue, the arrest, and sentence of the Calcutta court, and the restoration of Mr. Fogg and himself to liberty on bail.

1502
02:46:43,960 --> 02:46:54,160
Fix, who was familiar with the last events, seemed to be equally ignorant of all that Passepartout related; and the later was charmed to find so interested a listener.

1503
02:46:54,760 --> 02:46:58,240
"But does your master propose to carry this young woman to Europe?"

1504
02:46:59,080 --> 02:46:59,721
"Not at all.

1505
02:46:59,900 --> 02:47:05,620
We are simply going to place her under the protection of one of her relatives, a rich merchant at Hong Kong."

1506
02:47:06,340 --> 02:47:11,020
"Nothing to be done there," said Fix to himself, concealing his disappointment.

1507
02:47:11,460 --> 02:47:13,740
"A glass of gin, Mr. Passepartout?"

1508
02:47:14,319 --> 02:47:15,660
"Willingly, Monsieur Fix.

1509
02:47:15,940 --> 02:47:20,561
We must at least have a friendly glass on board the Rangoon."

Chapter 17

1516
02:47:45,720 --> 02:47:50,080
SHOWING WHAT HAPPENED ON THE VOYAGE FROM SINGAPORE TO HONG KONG

1517
02:47:50,540 --> 02:48:01,460
The detective and Passepartout met often on deck after this interview, though Fix was reserved, and did not attempt to induce his companion to divulge any more facts concerning Mr. Fogg.

1518
02:48:02,040 --> 02:48:13,820
He caught a glimpse of that mysterious gentleman once or twice; but Mr. Fogg usually confined himself to the cabin, where he kept Aouda company, or, according to his inveterate habit, took a hand at whist.

1519
02:48:14,641 --> 02:48:22,699
Passepartout began very seriously to conjecture what strange chance kept Fix still on the route that his master was pursuing.

1520
02:48:22,720 --> 02:48:42,640
It was really worth considering why this certainly very amiable and complacent person, whom he had first met at Suez, had then encountered on board the Mongolia, who disembarked at Bombay, which he announced as his destination, and now turned up so unexpectedly on the Rangoon, was following Mr. Fogg's tracks step by step.

1521
02:48:43,380 --> 02:48:44,700
What was Fix's object?

1522
02:48:45,440 --> 02:48:56,260
Passepartout was ready to wager his Indian shoes--which he religiously preserved--that Fix would also leave Hong Kong at the same time with them, and probably on the same steamer.

1523
02:48:57,301 --> 02:49:04,020
Passepartout might have cudgelled his brain for a century without hitting upon the real object which the detective had in view.

1524
02:49:04,840 --> 02:49:09,920
He never could have imagined that Phileas Fogg was being tracked as a robber around the globe.

1525
02:49:10,680 --> 02:49:21,380
But, as it is in human nature to attempt the solution of every mystery, Passepartout suddenly discovered an explanation of Fix's movements, which was in truth far from unreasonable.

1526
02:49:22,140 --> 02:49:32,240
Fix, he thought, could only be an agent of Mr. Fogg's friends at the Reform Club, sent to follow him up, and to ascertain that he really went round the world as had been agreed upon.

1527
02:49:32,900 --> 02:49:33,641
"It's clear!"

1528
02:49:34,040 --> 02:49:36,920
repeated the worthy servant to himself, proud of his shrewdness.

1529
02:49:37,280 --> 02:49:39,520
"He's a spy sent to keep us in view!

1530
02:49:40,080 --> 02:49:45,120
That isn't quite the thing, either, to be spying Mr. Fogg, who is so honourable a man!

1531
02:49:45,780 --> 02:49:48,840
Ah, gentlemen of the Reform, this shall cost you dear!"

1532
02:49:49,520 --> 02:49:58,780
Passepartout, enchanted with his discovery, resolved to say nothing to his master, lest he should be justly offended at this mistrust on the part of his adversaries.

1533
02:49:59,420 --> 02:50:08,159
But he determined to chaff Fix, when he had the chance, with mysterious allusions, which, however, need not betray his real suspicions.

1534
02:50:09,200 --> 02:50:18,600
During the afternoon of Wednesday, 30th October, the Rangoon entered the Strait of Malacca, which separates the peninsula of that name from Sumatra.

1535
02:50:19,260 --> 02:50:25,180
The mountainous and craggy islets intercepted the beauties of this noble island from the view of the travellers.

1536
02:50:26,100 --> 02:50:34,721
The Rangoon weighed anchor at Singapore the next day at four a.m., to receive coal, having gained half a day on the prescribed time of her arrival.

1537
02:50:35,319 --> 02:50:43,880
Phileas Fogg noted this gain in his journal, and then, accompanied by Aouda, who betrayed a desire for a walk on shore, disembarked.

1538
02:50:45,000 --> 02:50:57,800
Fix, who suspected Mr. Fogg's every movement, followed them cautiously, without being himself perceived; while Passepartout, laughing in his sleeve at Fix's manoeuvres, went about his usual errands.

1539
02:50:58,580 --> 02:51:07,140
The island of Singapore is not imposing in aspect, for there are no mountains; yet its appearance is not without attractions.

1540
02:51:07,520 --> 02:51:11,340
It is a park checkered by pleasant highways and avenues.

1541
02:51:11,660 --> 02:51:25,181
A handsome carriage, drawn by a sleek pair of New Holland horses, carried Phileas Fogg and Aouda into the midst of rows of palms with brilliant foliage, and of clove-trees, whereof the cloves form the heart of a half-open flower.

1542
02:51:25,720 --> 02:51:40,520
Pepper plants replaced the prickly hedges of European fields; sago-bushes, large ferns with gorgeous branches, varied the aspect of this tropical clime; while nutmeg-trees in full foliage filled the air with a penetrating perfume.

1543
02:51:41,120 --> 02:51:47,940
Agile and grinning bands of monkeys skipped about in the trees, nor were tigers wanting in the jungles.

1544
02:51:48,880 --> 02:52:09,800
After a drive of two hours through the country, Aouda and Mr. Fogg returned to the town, which is a vast collection of heavy-looking, irregular houses, surrounded by charming gardens rich in tropical fruits and plants; and at ten o'clock they re-embarked, closely followed by the detective, who had kept them constantly in sight.

1545
02:52:10,900 --> 02:52:28,160
Passepartout, who had been purchasing several dozen mangoes--a fruit as large as good-sized apples, of a dark-brown colour outside and a bright red within, and whose white pulp, melting in the mouth, affords gourmands a delicious sensation--was waiting for them on deck.

1546
02:52:28,540 --> 02:52:34,060
He was only too glad to offer some mangoes to Aouda, who thanked him very gracefully for them.

1547
02:52:35,240 --> 02:52:47,080
At eleven o'clock the Rangoon rode out of Singapore harbour, and in a few hours the high mountains of Malacca, with their forests, inhabited by the most beautifully-furred tigers in the world, were lost to view.

1548
02:52:48,020 --> 02:52:56,320
Singapore is distant some thirteen hundred miles from the island of Hong Kong, which is a little English colony near the Chinese coast.

1549
02:52:57,140 --> 02:53:07,560
Phileas Fogg hoped to accomplish the journey in six days, so as to be in time for the steamer which would leave on the 6th of November for Yokohama, the principal Japanese port.

1550
02:53:08,460 --> 02:53:21,580
The Rangoon had a large quota of passengers, many of whom disembarked at Singapore, among them a number of Indians, Ceylonese, Chinamen, Malays, and Portuguese, mostly second-class travellers.

1551
02:53:22,560 --> 02:53:27,199
The weather, which had hitherto been fine, changed with the last quarter of the moon.

1552
02:53:27,800 --> 02:53:37,780
The sea rolled heavily, and the wind at intervals rose almost to a storm, but happily blew from the south-west, and thus aided the steamer's progress.

1553
02:53:38,440 --> 02:53:49,120
The captain as often as possible put up his sails, and under the double action of steam and sail the vessel made rapid progress along the coasts of Anam and Cochin China.

1554
02:53:50,141 --> 02:54:07,479
Owing to the defective construction of the Rangoon, however, unusual precautions became necessary in unfavourable weather; but the loss of time which resulted from this cause, while it nearly drove Passepartout out of his senses, did not seem to affect his master in the least.

1555
02:54:08,140 --> 02:54:16,040
Passepartout blamed the captain, the engineer, and the crew, and consigned all who were connected with the ship to the land where the pepper grows.

1556
02:54:16,740 --> 02:54:25,180
Perhaps the thought of the gas, which was remorselessly burning at his expense in Saville Row, had something to do with his hot impatience.

1557
02:54:25,640 --> 02:54:29,940
"You are in a great hurry, then," said Fix to him one day, "to reach Hong Kong?"

1558
02:54:30,500 --> 02:54:31,439
"A very great hurry!"

1559
02:54:32,180 --> 02:54:35,840
"Mr. Fogg, I suppose, is anxious to catch the steamer for Yokohama?"

1560
02:54:36,440 --> 02:54:37,540
"Terribly anxious."

1561
02:54:38,260 --> 02:54:40,860
"You believe in this journey around the world, then?"

1562
02:54:41,680 --> 02:54:42,420
"Absolutely.

1563
02:54:42,580 --> 02:54:43,800
Don't you, Mr. Fix?"

1564
02:54:44,520 --> 02:54:44,979
"I?

1565
02:54:45,220 --> 02:54:46,720
I don't believe a word of it."

1566
02:54:47,160 --> 02:54:48,399
"You're a sly dog!"

1567
02:54:48,620 --> 02:54:50,340
said Passepartout, winking at him.

1568
02:54:51,040 --> 02:54:54,360
This expression rather disturbed Fix, without his knowing why.

1569
02:54:55,020 --> 02:54:57,240
Had the Frenchman guessed his real purpose?

1570
02:54:57,660 --> 02:54:58,880
He knew not what to think.

1571
02:54:59,540 --> 02:55:03,140
But how could Passepartout have discovered that he was a detective?

1572
02:55:03,960 --> 02:55:08,779
Yet, in speaking as he did, the man evidently meant more than he expressed.

1573
02:55:09,641 --> 02:55:14,220
Passepartout went still further the next day; he could not hold his tongue.

1574
02:55:14,800 --> 02:55:22,040
"Mr. Fix," said he, in a bantering tone, "shall we be so unfortunate as to lose you when we get to Hong Kong?"

1575
02:55:22,761 --> 02:55:27,841
"Why," responded Fix, a little embarrassed, "I don't know; perhaps--"

1576
02:55:28,140 --> 02:55:30,080
"Ah, if you would only go on with us!

1577
02:55:30,460 --> 02:55:34,240
An agent of the Peninsular Company, you know, can't stop on the way!

1578
02:55:34,800 --> 02:55:37,780
You were only going to Bombay, and here you are in China.

1579
02:55:38,319 --> 02:55:42,540
America is not far off, and from America to Europe is only a step."

1580
02:55:43,260 --> 02:55:49,200
Fix looked intently at his companion, whose countenance was as serene as possible, and laughed with him.

1581
02:55:49,739 --> 02:55:55,700
But Passepartout persisted in chaffing him by asking him if he made much by his present occupation.

1582
02:55:56,279 --> 02:56:01,200
"Yes, and no," returned Fix; "there is good and bad luck in such things.

1583
02:56:01,680 --> 02:56:05,020
But you must understand that I don't travel at my own expense."

1584
02:56:05,460 --> 02:56:07,360
"Oh, I am quite sure of that!"

1585
02:56:07,520 --> 02:56:09,340
cried Passepartout, laughing heartily.

1586
02:56:10,040 --> 02:56:14,880
Fix, fairly puzzled, descended to his cabin and gave himself up to his reflections.

1587
02:56:15,561 --> 02:56:21,181
He was evidently suspected; somehow or other the Frenchman had found out that he was a detective.

1588
02:56:21,760 --> 02:56:23,080
But had he told his master?

1589
02:56:23,860 --> 02:56:28,500
What part was he playing in all this: was he an accomplice or not?

1590
02:56:29,060 --> 02:56:30,080
Was the game, then, up?

1591
02:56:31,080 --> 02:56:44,820
Fix spent several hours turning these things over in his mind, sometimes thinking that all was lost, then persuading himself that Fogg was ignorant of his presence, and then undecided what course it was best to take.

1592
02:56:45,580 --> 02:56:51,960
Nevertheless, he preserved his coolness of mind, and at last resolved to deal plainly with Passepartout.

1593
02:56:52,681 --> 02:57:03,240
If he did not find it practicable to arrest Fogg at Hong Kong, and if Fogg made preparations to leave that last foothold of English territory, he, Fix, would tell Passepartout all.

1594
02:57:03,899 --> 02:57:17,840
Either the servant was the accomplice of his master, and in this case the master knew of his operations, and he should fail; or else the servant knew nothing about the robbery, and then his interest would be to abandon the robber.

1595
02:57:18,561 --> 02:57:21,859
Such was the situation between Fix and Passepartout.

1596
02:57:22,540 --> 02:57:28,640
Meanwhile Phileas Fogg moved about above them in the most majestic and unconscious indifference.

1597
02:57:29,280 --> 02:57:35,580
He was passing methodically in his orbit around the world, regardless of the lesser stars which gravitated around him.

1598
02:57:36,600 --> 02:57:44,460
Yet there was near by what the astronomers would call a disturbing star, which might have produced an agitation in this gentleman's heart.

1599
02:57:45,040 --> 02:57:45,760
But no!

1600
02:57:45,899 --> 02:57:58,580
the charms of Aouda failed to act, to Passepartout's great surprise; and the disturbances, if they existed, would have been more difficult to calculate than those of Uranus which led to the discovery of Neptune.

1601
02:57:59,380 --> 02:58:06,960
It was every day an increasing wonder to Passepartout, who read in Aouda's eyes the depths of her gratitude to his master.

1602
02:58:07,860 --> 02:58:12,380
Phileas Fogg, though brave and gallant, must be, he thought, quite heartless.

1603
02:58:12,940 --> 02:58:22,760
As to the sentiment which this journey might have awakened in him, there was clearly no trace of such a thing; while poor Passepartout existed in perpetual reveries.

1604
02:58:23,920 --> 02:58:32,420
One day he was leaning on the railing of the engine-room, and was observing the engine, when a sudden pitch of the steamer threw the screw out of the water.

1605
02:58:32,960 --> 02:58:37,380
The steam came hissing out of the valves; and this made Passepartout indignant.

1606
02:58:38,080 --> 02:58:40,200
"The valves are not sufficiently charged!"

1607
02:58:40,380 --> 02:58:41,080
he exclaimed.

1608
02:58:41,561 --> 02:58:42,600
"We are not going.

1609
02:58:43,000 --> 02:58:44,040
Oh, these English!

1610
02:58:44,279 --> 02:58:50,040
If this was an American craft, we should blow up, perhaps, but we should at all events go faster!"

Chapter 18

1617
02:59:16,480 --> 02:59:23,160
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG, PASSEPARTOUT, AND FIX GO EACH ABOUT HIS BUSINESS

1618
02:59:23,960 --> 02:59:27,140
The weather was bad during the latter days of the voyage.

1619
02:59:27,460 --> 02:59:33,000
The wind, obstinately remaining in the north-west, blew a gale, and retarded the steamer.

1620
02:59:33,840 --> 02:59:41,760
The Rangoon rolled heavily and the passengers became impatient of the long, monstrous waves which the wind raised before their path.

1621
02:59:42,479 --> 02:59:49,820
A sort of tempest arose on the 3rd of November, the squall knocking the vessel about with fury, and the waves running high.

1622
02:59:50,460 --> 02:59:56,900
The Rangoon reefed all her sails, and even the rigging proved too much, whistling and shaking amid the squall.

1623
02:59:57,641 --> 03:00:06,780
The steamer was forced to proceed slowly, and the captain estimated that she would reach Hong Kong twenty hours behind time, and more if the storm lasted.

1624
03:00:07,800 --> 03:00:15,920
Phileas Fogg gazed at the tempestuous sea, which seemed to be struggling especially to delay him, with his habitual tranquillity.

1625
03:00:16,399 --> 03:00:26,440
He never changed countenance for an instant, though a delay of twenty hours, by making him too late for the Yokohama boat, would almost inevitably cause the loss of the wager.

1626
03:00:27,280 --> 03:00:36,160
But this man of nerve manifested neither impatience nor annoyance; it seemed as if the storm were a part of his programme, and had been foreseen.

1627
03:00:36,800 --> 03:00:41,359
Aouda was amazed to find him as calm as he had been from the first time she saw him.

1628
03:00:42,380 --> 03:00:45,380
Fix did not look at the state of things in the same light.

1629
03:00:45,960 --> 03:00:47,580
The storm greatly pleased him.

1630
03:00:48,120 --> 03:00:55,280
His satisfaction would have been complete had the Rangoon been forced to retreat before the violence of wind and waves.

1631
03:00:55,300 --> 03:01:07,940
Each delay filled him with hope, for it became more and more probable that Fogg would be obliged to remain some days at Hong Kong; and now the heavens themselves became his allies, with the gusts and squalls.

1632
03:01:08,600 --> 03:01:19,820
It mattered not that they made him sea-sick--he made no account of this inconvenience; and, whilst his body was writhing under their effects, his spirit bounded with hopeful exultation.

1633
03:01:20,660 --> 03:01:25,181
Passepartout was enraged beyond expression by the unpropitious weather.

1634
03:01:25,200 --> 03:01:27,520
Everything had gone so well till now!

1635
03:01:28,020 --> 03:01:36,520
Earth and sea had seemed to be at his master's service; steamers and railways obeyed him; wind and steam united to speed his journey.

1636
03:01:37,080 --> 03:01:39,020
Had the hour of adversity come?

1637
03:01:39,520 --> 03:01:45,100
Passepartout was as much excited as if the twenty thousand pounds were to come from his own pocket.

1638
03:01:45,359 --> 03:01:52,899
The storm exasperated him, the gale made him furious, and he longed to lash the obstinate sea into obedience.

1639
03:01:53,280 --> 03:01:53,899
Poor fellow!

1640
03:01:55,040 --> 03:02:04,279
Fix carefully concealed from him his own satisfaction, for, had he betrayed it, Passepartout could scarcely have restrained himself from personal violence.

1641
03:02:05,160 --> 03:02:16,980
Passepartout remained on deck as long as the tempest lasted, being unable to remain quiet below, and taking it into his head to aid the progress of the ship by lending a hand with the crew.

1642
03:02:17,840 --> 03:02:24,920
He overwhelmed the captain, officers, and sailors, who could not help laughing at his impatience, with all sorts of questions.

1643
03:02:25,020 --> 03:02:33,920
He wanted to know exactly how long the storm was going to last; whereupon he was referred to the barometer, which seemed to have no intention of rising.

1644
03:02:34,500 --> 03:02:42,880
Passepartout shook it, but with no perceptible effect; for neither shaking nor maledictions could prevail upon it to change its mind.

1645
03:02:43,700 --> 03:02:52,641
On the 4th, however, the sea became more calm, and the storm lessened its violence; the wind veered southward, and was once more favourable.

1646
03:02:53,239 --> 03:02:55,320
Passepartout cleared up with the weather.

1647
03:02:56,399 --> 03:03:01,560
Some of the sails were unfurled, and the Rangoon resumed its most rapid speed.

1648
03:03:02,200 --> 03:03:05,440
The time lost could not, however, be regained.

1649
03:03:05,460 --> 03:03:11,400
Land was not signalled until five o'clock on the morning of the 6th; the steamer was due on the 5th.

1650
03:03:11,979 --> 03:03:18,240
Phileas Fogg was twenty-four hours behind-hand, and the Yokohama steamer would, of course, be missed.

1651
03:03:19,280 --> 03:03:26,720
The pilot went on board at six, and took his place on the bridge, to guide the Rangoon through the channels to the port of Hong Kong.

1652
03:03:27,340 --> 03:03:37,280
Passepartout longed to ask him if the steamer had left for Yokohama; but he dared not, for he wished to preserve the spark of hope, which still remained till the last moment.

1653
03:03:37,980 --> 03:03:50,040
He had confided his anxiety to Fix who--the sly rascal!--tried to console him by saying that Mr. Fogg would be in time if he took the next boat; but this only put Passepartout in a passion.

1654
03:03:51,280 --> 03:04:01,500
Mr. Fogg, bolder than his servant, did not hesitate to approach the pilot, and tranquilly ask him if he knew when a steamer would leave Hong Kong for Yokohama.

1655
03:04:01,561 --> 03:04:04,520
"At high tide to-morrow morning," answered the pilot.

1656
03:04:05,160 --> 03:04:05,620
"Ah!"

1657
03:04:05,660 --> 03:04:08,460
said Mr. Fogg, without betraying any astonishment.

1658
03:04:09,580 --> 03:04:16,360
Passepartout, who heard what passed, would willingly have embraced the pilot, while Fix would have been glad to twist his neck.

1659
03:04:17,020 --> 03:04:18,480
"What is the steamer's name?"

1660
03:04:18,800 --> 03:04:19,721
asked Mr. Fogg.

1661
03:04:20,340 --> 03:04:21,300
"The Carnatic."

1662
03:04:21,860 --> 03:04:23,760
"Ought she not to have gone yesterday?"

1663
03:04:24,380 --> 03:04:30,561
"Yes, sir; but they had to repair one of her boilers, and so her departure was postponed till to-morrow."

1664
03:04:31,280 --> 03:04:35,420
"Thank you," returned Mr. Fogg, descending mathematically to the saloon.

1665
03:04:36,400 --> 03:04:43,920
Passepartout clasped the pilot's hand and shook it heartily in his delight, exclaiming, "Pilot, you are the best of good fellows!"

1666
03:04:44,520 --> 03:04:51,420
The pilot probably does not know to this day why his responses won him this enthusiastic greeting.

1667
03:04:52,320 --> 03:05:00,000
He remounted the bridge, and guided the steamer through the flotilla of junks, tankas, and fishing boats which crowd the harbour of Hong Kong.

1668
03:05:01,080 --> 03:05:05,980
At one o'clock the Rangoon was at the quay, and the passengers were going ashore.

1669
03:05:06,940 --> 03:05:22,540
Chance had strangely favoured Phileas Fogg, for had not the Carnatic been forced to lie over for repairing her boilers, she would have left on the 6th of November, and the passengers for Japan would have been obliged to await for a week the sailing of the next steamer.

1670
03:05:23,400 --> 03:05:31,260
Mr. Fogg was, it is true, twenty-four hours behind his time; but this could not seriously imperil the remainder of his tour.

1671
03:05:32,700 --> 03:05:54,400
The steamer which crossed the Pacific from Yokohama to San Francisco made a direct connection with that from Hong Kong, and it could not sail until the latter reached Yokohama; and if Mr. Fogg was twenty-four hours late on reaching Yokohama, this time would no doubt be easily regained in the voyage of twenty-two days across the Pacific.

1672
03:05:55,340 --> 03:06:01,160
He found himself, then, about twenty-four hours behind-hand, thirty-five days after leaving London.

1673
03:06:02,620 --> 03:06:06,439
The Carnatic was announced to leave Hong Kong at five the next morning.

1674
03:06:07,101 --> 03:06:15,180
Mr. Fogg had sixteen hours in which to attend to his business there, which was to deposit Aouda safely with her wealthy relative.

1675
03:06:16,000 --> 03:06:21,020
On landing, he conducted her to a palanquin, in which they repaired to the Club Hotel.

1676
03:06:21,800 --> 03:06:29,800
A room was engaged for the young woman, and Mr. Fogg, after seeing that she wanted for nothing, set out in search of her cousin Jeejeeh.

1677
03:06:30,601 --> 03:06:37,979
He instructed Passepartout to remain at the hotel until his return, that Aouda might not be left entirely alone.

1678
03:06:39,220 --> 03:06:48,101
Mr. Fogg repaired to the Exchange, where, he did not doubt, every one would know so wealthy and considerable a personage as the Parsee merchant.

1679
03:06:48,960 --> 03:07:05,480
Meeting a broker, he made the inquiry, to learn that Jeejeeh had left China two years before, and, retiring from business with an immense fortune, had taken up his residence in Europe--in Holland the broker thought, with the merchants of which country he had principally traded.

1680
03:07:06,440 --> 03:07:18,000
Phileas Fogg returned to the hotel, begged a moment's conversation with Aouda, and without more ado, apprised her that Jeejeeh was no longer at Hong Kong, but probably in Holland.

1681
03:07:19,080 --> 03:07:20,720
Aouda at first said nothing.

1682
03:07:21,240 --> 03:07:24,920
She passed her hand across her forehead, and reflected a few moments.

1683
03:07:25,420 --> 03:07:30,100
Then, in her sweet, soft voice, she said: "What ought I to do, Mr. Fogg?"

1684
03:07:31,260 --> 03:07:33,460
"It is very simple," responded the gentleman.

1685
03:07:33,460 --> 03:07:34,939
"Go on to Europe."

1686
03:07:35,760 --> 03:07:37,301
"But I cannot intrude--"

1687
03:07:38,080 --> 03:07:42,040
"You do not intrude, nor do you in the least embarrass my project.

1688
03:07:42,939 --> 03:07:43,561
Passepartout!"

1689
03:07:44,140 --> 03:07:44,540
"Monsieur."

1690
03:07:45,260 --> 03:07:48,240
"Go to the Carnatic, and engage three cabins."

1691
03:07:49,220 --> 03:07:59,740
Passepartout, delighted that the young woman, who was very gracious to him, was going to continue the journey with them, went off at a brisk gait to obey his master's order.

Chapter 19

1698
03:08:27,109 --> 03:08:33,380
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT TAKES A TOO GREAT INTEREST IN HIS MASTER, AND WHAT COMES OF IT

1699
03:08:34,120 --> 03:08:48,800
Hong Kong is an island which came into the possession of the English by the Treaty of Nankin, after the war of 1842; and the colonising genius of the English has created upon it an important city and an excellent port.

1700
03:08:49,399 --> 03:08:59,160
The island is situated at the mouth of the Canton River, and is separated by about sixty miles from the Portuguese town of Macao, on the opposite coast.

1701
03:08:59,800 --> 03:09:09,800
Hong Kong has beaten Macao in the struggle for the Chinese trade, and now the greater part of the transportation of Chinese goods finds its depot at the former place.

1702
03:09:10,641 --> 03:09:24,800
Docks, hospitals, wharves, a Gothic cathedral, a government house, macadamised streets, give to Hong Kong the appearance of a town in Kent or Surrey transferred by some strange magic to the antipodes.

1703
03:09:26,060 --> 03:09:40,840
Passepartout wandered, with his hands in his pockets, towards the Victoria port, gazing as he went at the curious palanquins and other modes of conveyance, and the groups of Chinese, Japanese, and Europeans who passed to and fro in the streets.

1704
03:09:41,360 --> 03:09:51,620
Hong Kong seemed to him not unlike Bombay, Calcutta, and Singapore, since, like them, it betrayed everywhere the evidence of English supremacy.

1705
03:09:51,640 --> 03:10:08,280
At the Victoria port he found a confused mass of ships of all nations: English, French, American, and Dutch, men-of-war and trading vessels, Japanese and Chinese junks, sempas, tankas, and flower-boats, which formed so many floating parterres.

1706
03:10:08,380 --> 03:10:15,360
Passepartout noticed in the crowd a number of the natives who seemed very old and were dressed in yellow.

1707
03:10:16,020 --> 03:10:26,540
On going into a barber's to get shaved he learned that these ancient men were all at least eighty years old, at which age they are permitted to wear yellow, which is the Imperial colour.

1708
03:10:27,200 --> 03:10:31,040
Passepartout, without exactly knowing why, thought this very funny.

1709
03:10:32,220 --> 03:10:39,220
On reaching the quay where they were to embark on the Carnatic, he was not astonished to find Fix walking up and down.

1710
03:10:40,000 --> 03:10:43,280
The detective seemed very much disturbed and disappointed.

1711
03:10:43,840 --> 03:10:48,160
"This is bad," muttered Passepartout, "for the gentlemen of the Reform Club!"

1712
03:10:48,840 --> 03:10:54,160
He accosted Fix with a merry smile, as if he had not perceived that gentleman's chagrin.

1713
03:10:54,960 --> 03:10:59,681
The detective had, indeed, good reasons to inveigh against the bad luck which pursued him.

1714
03:11:00,000 --> 03:11:01,800
The warrant had not come!

1715
03:11:02,420 --> 03:11:16,140
It was certainly on the way, but as certainly it could not now reach Hong Kong for several days; and, this being the last English territory on Mr. Fogg's route, the robber would escape, unless he could manage to detain him.

1716
03:11:17,239 --> 03:11:22,480
"Well, Monsieur Fix," said Passepartout, "have you decided to go with us so far as America?"

1717
03:11:23,280 --> 03:11:25,780
"Yes," returned Fix, through his set teeth.

1718
03:11:26,520 --> 03:11:27,140
"Good!"

1719
03:11:27,160 --> 03:11:29,220
exclaimed Passepartout, laughing heartily.

1720
03:11:29,660 --> 03:11:32,640
"I knew you could not persuade yourself to separate from us.

1721
03:11:32,979 --> 03:11:34,560
Come and engage your berth."

1722
03:11:35,920 --> 03:11:39,600
They entered the steamer office and secured cabins for four persons.

1723
03:11:40,140 --> 03:11:51,220
The clerk, as he gave them the tickets, informed them that, the repairs on the Carnatic having been completed, the steamer would leave that very evening, and not next morning, as had been announced.

1724
03:11:51,939 --> 03:11:55,120
"That will suit my master all the better," said Passepartout.

1725
03:11:55,740 --> 03:11:57,120
"I will go and let him know."

1726
03:11:58,220 --> 03:12:03,060
Fix now decided to make a bold move; he resolved to tell Passepartout all.

1727
03:12:03,779 --> 03:12:09,600
It seemed to be the only possible means of keeping Phileas Fogg several days longer at Hong Kong.

1728
03:12:10,540 --> 03:12:15,920
He accordingly invited his companion into a tavern which caught his eye on the quay.

1729
03:12:16,140 --> 03:12:23,880
On entering, they found themselves in a large room handsomely decorated, at the end of which was a large camp-bed furnished with cushions.

1730
03:12:24,760 --> 03:12:27,779
Several persons lay upon this bed in a deep sleep.

1731
03:12:28,560 --> 03:12:43,840
At the small tables which were arranged about the room some thirty customers were drinking English beer, porter, gin, and brandy; smoking, the while, long red clay pipes stuffed with little balls of opium mingled with essence of rose.

1732
03:12:44,480 --> 03:12:53,800
From time to time one of the smokers, overcome with the narcotic, would slip under the table, whereupon the waiters, taking him by the head and feet, carried and laid him upon the bed.

1733
03:12:54,540 --> 03:12:58,040
The bed already supported twenty of these stupefied sots.

1734
03:12:58,940 --> 03:13:19,479
Fix and Passepartout saw that they were in a smoking-house haunted by those wretched, cadaverous, idiotic creatures to whom the English merchants sell every year the miserable drug called opium, to the amount of one million four hundred thousand pounds--thousands devoted to one of the most despicable vices which afflict humanity!

1735
03:13:20,360 --> 03:13:25,440
The Chinese government has in vain attempted to deal with the evil by stringent laws.

1736
03:13:26,020 --> 03:13:35,920
It passed gradually from the rich, to whom it was at first exclusively reserved, to the lower classes, and then its ravages could not be arrested.

1737
03:13:35,939 --> 03:13:48,681
Opium is smoked everywhere, at all times, by men and women, in the Celestial Empire; and, once accustomed to it, the victims cannot dispense with it, except by suffering horrible bodily contortions and agonies.

1738
03:13:49,479 --> 03:13:55,260
A great smoker can smoke as many as eight pipes a day; but he dies in five years.

1739
03:13:55,840 --> 03:14:01,820
It was in one of these dens that Fix and Passepartout, in search of a friendly glass, found themselves.

1740
03:14:02,460 --> 03:14:10,500
Passepartout had no money, but willingly accepted Fix's invitation in the hope of returning the obligation at some future time.

1741
03:14:11,420 --> 03:14:18,340
They ordered two bottles of port, to which the Frenchman did ample justice, whilst Fix observed him with close attention.

1742
03:14:19,000 --> 03:14:25,960
They chatted about the journey, and Passepartout was especially merry at the idea that Fix was going to continue it with them.

1743
03:14:27,100 --> 03:14:34,140
When the bottles were empty, however, he rose to go and tell his master of the change in the time of the sailing of the Carnatic.

1744
03:14:35,000 --> 03:14:37,700
Fix caught him by the arm, and said, "Wait a moment."

1745
03:14:38,520 --> 03:14:39,601
"What for, Mr. Fix?"

1746
03:14:40,260 --> 03:14:42,080
"I want to have a serious talk with you."

1747
03:14:42,900 --> 03:14:44,040
"A serious talk!"

1748
03:14:44,221 --> 03:14:48,720
cried Passepartout, drinking up the little wine that was left in the bottom of his glass.

1749
03:14:49,260 --> 03:14:52,380
"Well, we'll talk about it to-morrow; I haven't time now."

1750
03:14:52,940 --> 03:14:53,400
"Stay!

1751
03:14:53,920 --> 03:14:56,300
What I have to say concerns your master."

1752
03:14:57,180 --> 03:15:00,360
Passepartout, at this, looked attentively at his companion.

1753
03:15:00,940 --> 03:15:03,680
Fix's face seemed to have a singular expression.

1754
03:15:04,460 --> 03:15:05,440
He resumed his seat.

1755
03:15:06,261 --> 03:15:07,779
"What is it that you have to say?"

1756
03:15:08,600 --> 03:15:15,340
Fix placed his hand upon Passepartout's arm, and, lowering his voice, said, "You have guessed who I am?"

1757
03:15:16,260 --> 03:15:16,840
"Parbleu!"

1758
03:15:17,141 --> 03:15:18,479
said Passepartout, smiling.

1759
03:15:19,420 --> 03:15:21,280
"Then I'm going to tell you everything--"

1760
03:15:22,100 --> 03:15:24,160
"Now that I know everything, my friend!

1761
03:15:24,480 --> 03:15:24,760
Ah!

1762
03:15:24,979 --> 03:15:25,900
that's very good.

1763
03:15:26,460 --> 03:15:27,800
But go on, go on.

1764
03:15:28,500 --> 03:15:33,500
First, though, let me tell you that those gentlemen have put themselves to a useless expense."

1765
03:15:34,439 --> 03:15:35,140
"Useless!"

1766
03:15:35,380 --> 03:15:36,040
said Fix.

1767
03:15:36,360 --> 03:15:37,640
"You speak confidently.

1768
03:15:38,020 --> 03:15:40,920
It's clear that you don't know how large the sum is."

1769
03:15:41,720 --> 03:15:43,899
"Of course I do," returned Passepartout.

1770
03:15:44,320 --> 03:15:45,859
"Twenty thousand pounds."

1771
03:15:46,660 --> 03:15:47,920
"Fifty-five thousand!"

1772
03:15:48,260 --> 03:15:50,500
answered Fix, pressing his companion's hand.

1773
03:15:50,560 --> 03:15:51,520
"What!"

1774
03:15:51,960 --> 03:15:52,720
cried the Frenchman.

1775
03:15:53,100 --> 03:15:56,540
"Has Monsieur Fogg dared--fifty-five thousand pounds!

1776
03:15:57,060 --> 03:16:02,040
Well, there's all the more reason for not losing an instant," he continued, getting up hastily.

1777
03:16:02,540 --> 03:16:12,120
Fix pushed Passepartout back in his chair, and resumed: "Fifty-five thousand pounds; and if I succeed, I get two thousand pounds.

1778
03:16:12,140 --> 03:16:15,899
If you'll help me, I'll let you have five hundred of them."

1779
03:16:16,000 --> 03:16:16,740
"Help you?"

1780
03:16:16,740 --> 03:16:19,319
cried Passepartout, whose eyes were standing wide open.

1781
03:16:19,840 --> 03:16:23,561
"Yes; help me keep Mr. Fogg here for two or three days."

1782
03:16:24,240 --> 03:16:25,520
"Why, what are you saying?

1783
03:16:25,920 --> 03:16:32,960
Those gentlemen are not satisfied with following my master and suspecting his honour, but they must try to put obstacles in his way!

1784
03:16:33,380 --> 03:16:34,300
I blush for them!"

1785
03:16:35,080 --> 03:16:35,760
"What do you mean?"

1786
03:16:36,700 --> 03:16:39,180
"I mean that it is a piece of shameful trickery.

1787
03:16:39,660 --> 03:16:43,600
They might as well waylay Mr. Fogg and put his money in their pockets!"

1788
03:16:44,200 --> 03:16:46,120
"That's just what we count on doing."

1789
03:16:46,760 --> 03:16:55,460
"It's a conspiracy, then," cried Passepartout, who became more and more excited as the liquor mounted in his head, for he drank without perceiving it.

1790
03:16:56,101 --> 03:16:57,540
"A real conspiracy!

1791
03:16:57,920 --> 03:16:59,140
And gentlemen, too.

1792
03:16:59,520 --> 03:16:59,960
Bah!"

1793
03:17:00,641 --> 03:17:01,860
Fix began to be puzzled.

1794
03:17:02,580 --> 03:17:04,140
"Members of the Reform Club!"

1795
03:17:04,500 --> 03:17:05,600
continued Passepartout.

1796
03:17:06,140 --> 03:17:13,720
"You must know, Monsieur Fix, that my master is an honest man, and that, when he makes a wager, he tries to win it fairly!"

1797
03:17:14,359 --> 03:17:16,040
"But who do you think I am?"

1798
03:17:16,279 --> 03:17:18,561
asked Fix, looking at him intently.

1799
03:17:19,260 --> 03:17:19,800
"Parbleu!

1800
03:17:20,420 --> 03:17:24,979
An agent of the members of the Reform Club, sent out here to interrupt my master's journey.

1801
03:17:25,660 --> 03:17:31,280
But, though I found you out some time ago, I've taken good care to say nothing about it to Mr. Fogg."

1802
03:17:32,400 --> 03:17:33,880
"He knows nothing, then?"

1803
03:17:34,439 --> 03:17:38,100
"Nothing," replied Passepartout, again emptying his glass.

1804
03:17:38,920 --> 03:17:43,640
The detective passed his hand across his forehead, hesitating before he spoke again.

1805
03:17:44,280 --> 03:17:45,061
What should he do?

1806
03:17:45,920 --> 03:17:51,061
Passepartout's mistake seemed sincere, but it made his design more difficult.

1807
03:17:51,880 --> 03:17:57,260
It was evident that the servant was not the master's accomplice, as Fix had been inclined to suspect.

1808
03:17:58,141 --> 03:18:03,840
"Well," said the detective to himself, "as he is not an accomplice, he will help me."

1809
03:18:04,600 --> 03:18:10,980
He had no time to lose: Fogg must be detained at Hong Kong, so he resolved to make a clean breast of it.

1810
03:18:11,900 --> 03:18:13,720
"Listen to me," said Fix abruptly.

1811
03:18:14,220 --> 03:18:17,680
"I am not, as you think, an agent of the members of the Reform Club--"

1812
03:18:18,640 --> 03:18:18,940
"Bah!"

1813
03:18:19,319 --> 03:18:21,720
retorted Passepartout, with an air of raillery.

1814
03:18:22,460 --> 03:18:26,060
"I am a police detective, sent out here by the London office."

1815
03:18:26,700 --> 03:18:27,840
"You, a detective?"

1816
03:18:28,540 --> 03:18:29,460
"I will prove it.

1817
03:18:29,681 --> 03:18:30,720
Here is my commission."

1818
03:18:31,760 --> 03:18:39,061
Passepartout was speechless with astonishment when Fix displayed this document, the genuineness of which could not be doubted.

1819
03:18:39,800 --> 03:18:46,660
"Mr. Fogg's wager," resumed Fix, "is only a pretext, of which you and the gentlemen of the Reform are dupes.

1820
03:18:47,199 --> 03:18:50,280
He had a motive for securing your innocent complicity."

1821
03:18:51,100 --> 03:18:51,640
"But why?"

1822
03:18:52,340 --> 03:18:52,681
"Listen.

1823
03:18:53,420 --> 03:19:03,460
On the 28th of last September a robbery of fifty-five thousand pounds was committed at the Bank of England by a person whose description was fortunately secured.

1824
03:19:04,120 --> 03:19:09,360
Here is his description; it answers exactly to that of Mr. Phileas Fogg."

1825
03:19:10,080 --> 03:19:11,320
"What nonsense!"

1826
03:19:11,680 --> 03:19:14,700
cried Passepartout, striking the table with his fist.

1827
03:19:15,140 --> 03:19:17,760
"My master is the most honourable of men!"

1828
03:19:18,439 --> 03:19:19,601
"How can you tell?

1829
03:19:20,040 --> 03:19:22,020
You know scarcely anything about him.

1830
03:19:22,640 --> 03:19:31,221
You went into his service the day he came away; and he came away on a foolish pretext, without trunks, and carrying a large amount in banknotes.

1831
03:19:31,800 --> 03:19:35,320
And yet you are bold enough to assert that he is an honest man!"

1832
03:19:36,061 --> 03:19:39,080
"Yes, yes," repeated the poor fellow, mechanically.

1833
03:19:39,800 --> 03:19:42,641
"Would you like to be arrested as his accomplice?"

1834
03:19:43,620 --> 03:19:50,641
Passepartout, overcome by what he had heard, held his head between his hands, and did not dare to look at the detective.

1835
03:19:51,400 --> 03:19:56,400
Phileas Fogg, the saviour of Aouda, that brave and generous man, a robber!

1836
03:19:57,560 --> 03:20:00,101
And yet how many presumptions there were against him!

1837
03:20:01,100 --> 03:20:09,320
Passepartout essayed to reject the suspicions which forced themselves upon his mind; he did not wish to believe that his master was guilty.

1838
03:20:10,340 --> 03:20:12,000
"Well, what do you want of me?"

1839
03:20:12,279 --> 03:20:14,080
said he, at last, with an effort.

1840
03:20:14,820 --> 03:20:24,220
"See here," replied Fix; "I have tracked Mr. Fogg to this place, but as yet I have failed to receive the warrant of arrest for which I sent to London.

1841
03:20:24,880 --> 03:20:27,700
You must help me to keep him here in Hong Kong--"

1842
03:20:28,520 --> 03:20:28,820
"I!

1843
03:20:29,280 --> 03:20:29,580
But I--"

1844
03:20:30,260 --> 03:20:35,221
"I will share with you the two thousand pounds reward offered by the Bank of England."

1845
03:20:35,721 --> 03:20:36,160
"Never!"

1846
03:20:36,700 --> 03:20:42,000
replied Passepartout, who tried to rise, but fell back, exhausted in mind and body.

1847
03:20:42,680 --> 03:21:02,540
"Mr. Fix," he stammered, "even should what you say be true--if my master is really the robber you are seeking for--which I deny--I have been, am, in his service; I have seen his generosity and goodness; and I will never betray him--not for all the gold in the world.

1848
03:21:03,180 --> 03:21:06,300
I come from a village where they don't eat that kind of bread!"

1849
03:21:07,340 --> 03:21:08,340
"You refuse?"

1850
03:21:08,940 --> 03:21:10,240
"I refuse."

1851
03:21:11,020 --> 03:21:15,020
"Consider that I've said nothing," said Fix; "and let us drink."

1852
03:21:15,779 --> 03:21:17,239
"Yes; let us drink!"

1853
03:21:18,439 --> 03:21:22,720
Passepartout felt himself yielding more and more to the effects of the liquor.

1854
03:21:23,480 --> 03:21:29,740
Fix, seeing that he must, at all hazards, be separated from his master, wished to entirely overcome him.

1855
03:21:30,700 --> 03:21:33,320
Some pipes full of opium lay upon the table.

1856
03:21:34,040 --> 03:21:36,620
Fix slipped one into Passepartout's hand.

1857
03:21:37,080 --> 03:21:46,020
He took it, put it between his lips, lit it, drew several puffs, and his head, becoming heavy under the influence of the narcotic, fell upon the table.

1858
03:21:47,120 --> 03:21:48,080
"At last!"

1859
03:21:48,340 --> 03:21:50,840
said Fix, seeing Passepartout unconscious.

1860
03:21:51,500 --> 03:21:59,160
"Mr. Fogg will not be informed of the Carnatic's departure; and, if he is, he will have to go without this cursed Frenchman!"

1861
03:22:00,340 --> 03:22:03,440
And, after paying his bill, Fix left the tavern.

1862

Chapter 20

1868
03:22:30,959 --> 03:22:35,070
IN WHICH FIX COMES FACE TO FACE WITH PHILEAS FOGG

1869
03:22:35,840 --> 03:22:51,920
While these events were passing at the opium-house, Mr. Fogg, unconscious of the danger he was in of losing the steamer, was quietly escorting Aouda about the streets of the English quarter, making the necessary purchases for the long voyage before them.

1870
03:22:52,779 --> 03:23:03,140
It was all very well for an Englishman like Mr. Fogg to make the tour of the world with a carpet-bag; a lady could not be expected to travel comfortably under such conditions.

1871
03:23:03,840 --> 03:23:14,619
He acquitted his task with characteristic serenity, and invariably replied to the remonstrances of his fair companion, who was confused by his patience and generosity:

1872
03:23:15,200 --> 03:23:18,720
"It is in the interest of my journey--a part of my programme."

1873
03:23:19,780 --> 03:23:33,120
The purchases made, they returned to the hotel, where they dined at a sumptuously served table-d'hote; after which Aouda, shaking hands with her protector after the English fashion, retired to her room for rest.

1874
03:23:33,760 --> 03:23:40,360
Mr. Fogg absorbed himself throughout the evening in the perusal of The Times and Illustrated London News.

1875
03:23:41,220 --> 03:23:48,200
Had he been capable of being astonished at anything, it would have been not to see his servant return at bedtime.

1876
03:23:48,960 --> 03:23:56,460
But, knowing that the steamer was not to leave for Yokohama until the next morning, he did not disturb himself about the matter.

1877
03:23:57,260 --> 03:24:11,500
When Passepartout did not appear the next morning to answer his master's bell, Mr. Fogg, not betraying the least vexation, contented himself with taking his carpet-bag, calling Aouda, and sending for a palanquin.

1878
03:24:12,540 --> 03:24:19,020
It was then eight o'clock; at half-past nine, it being then high tide, the Carnatic would leave the harbour.

1879
03:24:19,560 --> 03:24:29,579
Mr. Fogg and Aouda got into the palanquin, their luggage being brought after on a wheelbarrow, and half an hour later stepped upon the quay whence they were to embark.

1880
03:24:30,280 --> 03:24:34,340
Mr. Fogg then learned that the Carnatic had sailed the evening before.

1881
03:24:34,961 --> 03:24:48,961
He had expected to find not only the steamer, but his domestic, and was forced to give up both; but no sign of disappointment appeared on his face, and he merely remarked to Aouda, "It is an accident, madam; nothing more."

1882
03:24:50,080 --> 03:24:53,700
At this moment a man who had been observing him attentively approached.

1883
03:24:54,240 --> 03:25:02,761
It was Fix, who, bowing, addressed Mr. Fogg:  "Were you not, like me, sir, a passenger by the Rangoon, which arrived yesterday?"

1884
03:25:03,439 --> 03:25:06,060
"I was, sir," replied Mr. Fogg coldly.

1885
03:25:06,619 --> 03:25:07,819
"But I have not the honour--"

1886
03:25:08,300 --> 03:25:10,660
"Pardon me; I thought I should find your servant here."

1887
03:25:11,199 --> 03:25:12,541
"Do you know where he is, sir?"

1888
03:25:12,840 --> 03:25:14,001
asked Aouda anxiously.

1889
03:25:14,020 --> 03:25:15,080
"What!"

1890
03:25:15,340 --> 03:25:17,260
responded Fix, feigning surprise.

1891
03:25:17,841 --> 03:25:18,779
"Is he not with you?"

1892
03:25:19,499 --> 03:25:20,699
"No," said Aouda.

1893
03:25:21,041 --> 03:25:23,480
"He has not made his appearance since yesterday.

1894
03:25:24,040 --> 03:25:26,420
Could he have gone on board the Carnatic without us?"

1895
03:25:27,020 --> 03:25:28,560
"Without you, madam?"

1896
03:25:28,580 --> 03:25:29,500
answered the detective.

1897
03:25:30,020 --> 03:25:33,119
"Excuse me, did you intend to sail in the Carnatic?"

1898
03:25:33,779 --> 03:25:34,260
"Yes, sir."

1899
03:25:34,859 --> 03:25:37,899
"So did I, madam, and I am excessively disappointed.

1900
03:25:38,480 --> 03:25:48,880
The Carnatic, its repairs being completed, left Hong Kong twelve hours before the stated time, without any notice being given; and we must now wait a week for another steamer."

1901
03:25:49,660 --> 03:25:52,979
As he said "a week" Fix felt his heart leap for joy.

1902
03:25:53,540 --> 03:25:55,860
Fogg detained at Hong Kong for a week!

1903
03:25:56,380 --> 03:26:02,140
There would be time for the warrant to arrive, and fortune at last favoured the representative of the law.

1904
03:26:02,859 --> 03:26:13,500
His horror may be imagined when he heard Mr. Fogg say, in his placid voice, "But there are other vessels besides the Carnatic, it seems to me, in the harbour of Hong Kong."

1905
03:26:14,180 --> 03:26:20,880
And, offering his arm to Aouda, he directed his steps toward the docks in search of some craft about to start.

1906
03:26:22,020 --> 03:26:28,040
Fix, stupefied, followed; it seemed as if he were attached to Mr. Fogg by an invisible thread.

1907
03:26:28,860 --> 03:26:33,800
Chance, however, appeared really to have abandoned the man it had hitherto served so well.

1908
03:26:34,540 --> 03:26:49,700
For three hours Phileas Fogg wandered about the docks, with the determination, if necessary, to charter a vessel to carry him to Yokohama; but he could only find vessels which were loading or unloading, and which could not therefore set sail.

1909
03:26:50,420 --> 03:26:51,939
Fix began to hope again.

1910
03:26:52,720 --> 03:27:03,819
But Mr. Fogg, far from being discouraged, was continuing his search, resolved not to stop if he had to resort to Macao, when he was accosted by a sailor on one of the wharves.

1911
03:27:04,399 --> 03:27:06,101
"Is your honour looking for a boat?"

1912
03:27:06,840 --> 03:27:08,700
"Have you a boat ready to sail?"

1913
03:27:09,360 --> 03:27:14,060
"Yes, your honour; a pilot-boat--No. 43--the best in the harbour."

1914
03:27:14,819 --> 03:27:16,020
"Does she go fast?"

1915
03:27:16,780 --> 03:27:19,199
"Between eight and nine knots the hour.

1916
03:27:19,580 --> 03:27:20,320
Will you look at her?"

1917
03:27:21,100 --> 03:27:21,721
"Yes."

1918
03:27:22,479 --> 03:27:24,200
"Your honour will be satisfied with her.

1919
03:27:24,561 --> 03:27:26,480
Is it for a sea excursion?"

1920
03:27:27,301 --> 03:27:28,860
"No; for a voyage."

1921
03:27:29,460 --> 03:27:30,180
"A voyage?"

1922
03:27:30,761 --> 03:27:33,920
"Yes, will you agree to take me to Yokohama?"

1923
03:27:34,840 --> 03:27:39,960
The sailor leaned on the railing, opened his eyes wide, and said, "Is your honour joking?"

1924
03:27:40,800 --> 03:27:41,360
"No.

1925
03:27:41,381 --> 03:27:48,539
I have missed the Carnatic, and I must get to Yokohama by the 14th at the latest, to take the boat for San Francisco."

1926
03:27:49,341 --> 03:27:52,900
"I am sorry," said the sailor; "but it is impossible."

1927
03:27:53,739 --> 03:28:01,320
"I offer you a hundred pounds per day, and an additional reward of two hundred pounds if I reach Yokohama in time."

1928
03:28:02,080 --> 03:28:03,339
"Are you in earnest?"

1929
03:28:04,221 --> 03:28:05,160
"Very much so."

1930
03:28:05,200 --> 03:28:16,419
The pilot walked away a little distance, and gazed out to sea, evidently struggling between the anxiety to gain a large sum and the fear of venturing so far.

1931
03:28:17,260 --> 03:28:19,439
Fix was in mortal suspense.

1932
03:28:20,200 --> 03:28:24,721
Mr. Fogg turned to Aouda and asked her, "You would not be afraid, would you, madam?"

1933
03:28:25,420 --> 03:28:28,479
"Not with you, Mr. Fogg," was her answer.

1934
03:28:29,460 --> 03:28:32,920
The pilot now returned, shuffling his hat in his hands.

1935
03:28:33,940 --> 03:28:34,979
"Well, pilot?"

1936
03:28:35,221 --> 03:28:36,180
said Mr. Fogg.

1937
03:28:37,200 --> 03:28:47,221
"Well, your honour," replied he, "I could not risk myself, my men, or my little boat of scarcely twenty tons on so long a voyage at this time of year.

1938
03:28:48,140 --> 03:28:54,460
Besides, we could not reach Yokohama in time, for it is sixteen hundred and sixty miles from Hong Kong."

1939
03:28:55,341 --> 03:28:57,840
"Only sixteen hundred," said Mr. Fogg.

1940
03:28:58,600 --> 03:28:59,859
"It's the same thing."

1941
03:29:00,779 --> 03:29:02,301
Fix breathed more freely.

1942
03:29:03,420 --> 03:29:07,439
"But," added the pilot, "it might be arranged another way."

1943
03:29:08,200 --> 03:29:09,780
Fix ceased to breathe at all.

1944
03:29:10,801 --> 03:29:11,541
"How?"

1945
03:29:11,560 --> 03:29:12,279
asked Mr. Fogg.

1946
03:29:13,020 --> 03:29:20,439
"By going to Nagasaki, at the extreme south of Japan, or even to Shanghai, which is only eight hundred miles from here.

1947
03:29:21,180 --> 03:29:30,461
In going to Shanghai we should not be forced to sail wide of the Chinese coast, which would be a great advantage, as the currents run northward, and would aid us."

1948
03:29:31,199 --> 03:29:38,480
"Pilot," said Mr. Fogg, "I must take the American steamer at Yokohama, and not at Shanghai or Nagasaki."

1949
03:29:39,480 --> 03:29:40,240
"Why not?"

1950
03:29:40,480 --> 03:29:41,220
returned the pilot.

1951
03:29:41,700 --> 03:29:45,540
"The San Francisco steamer does not start from Yokohama.

1952
03:29:45,560 --> 03:29:50,020
It puts in at Yokohama and Nagasaki, but it starts from Shanghai."

1953
03:29:51,101 --> 03:29:52,480
"You are sure of that?"

1954
03:29:53,120 --> 03:29:53,640
"Perfectly."

1955
03:29:54,681 --> 03:29:57,040
"And when does the boat leave Shanghai?"

1956
03:29:57,860 --> 03:30:00,140
"On the 11th, at seven in the evening.

1957
03:30:00,780 --> 03:30:13,520
We have, therefore, four days before us, that is ninety-six hours; and in that time, if we had good luck and a south-west wind, and the sea was calm, we could make those eight hundred miles to Shanghai."

1958
03:30:14,440 --> 03:30:15,880
"And you could go--"

1959
03:30:16,320 --> 03:30:20,561
"In an hour; as soon as provisions could be got aboard and the sails put up."

1960
03:30:21,460 --> 03:30:22,260
"It is a bargain.

1961
03:30:22,581 --> 03:30:24,180
Are you the master of the boat?"

1962
03:30:24,720 --> 03:30:27,640
"Yes; John Bunsby, master of the Tankadere."

1963
03:30:28,760 --> 03:30:30,061
"Would you like some earnest-money?"

1964
03:30:30,660 --> 03:30:32,500
"If it would not put your honour out--"

1965
03:30:33,061 --> 03:30:41,301
"Here are two hundred pounds on account sir," added Phileas Fogg, turning to Fix, "if you would like to take advantage--"

1966
03:30:41,660 --> 03:30:44,100
"Thanks, sir; I was about to ask the favour."

1967
03:30:45,000 --> 03:30:45,801
"Very well.

1968
03:30:45,819 --> 03:30:47,819
In half an hour we shall go on board."

1969
03:30:48,500 --> 03:30:49,939
"But poor Passepartout?"

1970
03:30:50,300 --> 03:30:53,960
urged Aouda, who was much disturbed by the servant's disappearance.

1971
03:30:54,641 --> 03:30:58,040
"I shall do all I can to find him," replied Phileas Fogg.

1972
03:30:59,400 --> 03:31:07,300
While Fix, in a feverish, nervous state, repaired to the pilot-boat, the others directed their course to the police-station at Hong Kong.

1973
03:31:08,181 --> 03:31:14,320
Phileas Fogg there gave Passepartout's description, and left a sum of money to be spent in the search for him.

1974
03:31:15,359 --> 03:31:27,000
The same formalities having been gone through at the French consulate, and the palanquin having stopped at the hotel for the luggage, which had been sent back there, they returned to the wharf.

1975
03:31:27,779 --> 03:31:36,300
It was now three o'clock; and pilot-boat No. 43, with its crew on board, and its provisions stored away, was ready for departure.

1976
03:31:37,380 --> 03:31:43,820
The Tankadere was a neat little craft of twenty tons, as gracefully built as if she were a racing yacht.

1977
03:31:44,439 --> 03:31:54,800
Her shining copper sheathing, her galvanised iron-work, her deck, white as ivory, betrayed the pride taken by John Bunsby in making her presentable.

1978
03:31:55,800 --> 03:32:15,301
Her two masts leaned a trifle backward; she carried brigantine, foresail, storm-jib, and standing-jib, and was well rigged for running before the wind; and she seemed capable of brisk speed, which, indeed, she had already proved by gaining several prizes in pilot-boat races.

1979
03:32:16,120 --> 03:32:24,620
The crew of the Tankadere was composed of John Bunsby, the master, and four hardy mariners, who were familiar with the Chinese seas.

1980
03:32:25,399 --> 03:32:39,359
John Bunsby, himself, a man of forty-five or thereabouts, vigorous, sunburnt, with a sprightly expression of the eye, and energetic and self-reliant countenance, would have inspired confidence in the most timid.

1981
03:32:40,479 --> 03:32:45,600
Phileas Fogg and Aouda went on board, where they found Fix already installed.

1982
03:32:46,381 --> 03:32:57,279
Below deck was a square cabin, of which the walls bulged out in the form of cots, above a circular divan; in the centre was a table provided with a swinging lamp.

1983
03:32:57,600 --> 03:33:00,360
The accommodation was confined, but neat.

1984
03:33:01,000 --> 03:33:07,221
"I am sorry to have nothing better to offer you," said Mr. Fogg to Fix, who bowed without responding.

1985
03:33:07,940 --> 03:33:13,680
The detective had a feeling akin to humiliation in profiting by the kindness of Mr. Fogg.

1986
03:33:14,399 --> 03:33:19,221
"It's certain," thought he, "though rascal as he is, he is a polite one!"

1987
03:33:20,501 --> 03:33:24,500
The sails and the English flag were hoisted at ten minutes past three.

1988
03:33:25,180 --> 03:33:32,561
Mr. Fogg and Aouda, who were seated on deck, cast a last glance at the quay, in the hope of espying Passepartout.

1989
03:33:33,540 --> 03:33:48,641
Fix was not without his fears lest chance should direct the steps of the unfortunate servant, whom he had so badly treated, in this direction; in which case an explanation the reverse of satisfactory to the detective must have ensued.

1990
03:33:49,579 --> 03:33:56,500
But the Frenchman did not appear, and, without doubt, was still lying under the stupefying influence of the opium.

1991
03:33:57,999 --> 03:34:10,899
John Bunsby, master, at length gave the order to start, and the Tankadere, taking the wind under her brigantine, foresail, and standing-jib, bounded briskly forward over the waves.

Chapter 21

1998
03:34:37,789 --> 03:34:45,280
IN WHICH THE MASTER OF THE "TANKADERE" RUNS GREAT RISK OF LOSING A REWARD OF TWO HUNDRED POUNDS

1999
03:34:45,980 --> 03:34:52,779
This voyage of eight hundred miles was a perilous venture on a craft of twenty tons, and at that season of the year.

2000
03:34:53,579 --> 03:35:02,860
The Chinese seas are usually boisterous, subject to terrible gales of wind, and especially during the equinoxes; and it was now early November.

2001
03:35:03,819 --> 03:35:17,539
It would clearly have been to the master's advantage to carry his passengers to Yokohama, since he was paid a certain sum per day; but he would have been rash to attempt such a voyage, and it was imprudent even to attempt to reach Shanghai.

2002
03:35:18,220 --> 03:35:25,319
But John Bunsby believed in the Tankadere, which rode on the waves like a seagull; and perhaps he was not wrong.

2003
03:35:26,561 --> 03:35:35,739
Late in the day they passed through the capricious channels of Hong Kong, and the Tankadere, impelled by favourable winds, conducted herself admirably.

2004
03:35:36,939 --> 03:35:44,880
"I do not need, pilot," said Phileas Fogg, when they got into the open sea, "to advise you to use all possible speed."

2005
03:35:45,940 --> 03:35:47,240
"Trust me, your honour.

2006
03:35:47,681 --> 03:35:50,601
We are carrying all the sail the wind will let us.

2007
03:35:51,020 --> 03:35:55,140
The poles would add nothing, and are only used when we are going into port."

2008
03:35:56,119 --> 03:35:59,899
"It's your trade, not mine, pilot, and I confide in you."

2009
03:36:01,260 --> 03:36:09,279
Phileas Fogg, with body erect and legs wide apart, standing like a sailor, gazed without staggering at the swelling waters.

2010
03:36:09,921 --> 03:36:20,460
The young woman, who was seated aft, was profoundly affected as she looked out upon the ocean, darkening now with the twilight, on which she had ventured in so frail a vessel.

2011
03:36:21,440 --> 03:36:26,160
Above her head rustled the white sails, which seemed like great white wings.

2012
03:36:26,600 --> 03:36:30,439
The boat, carried forward by the wind, seemed to be flying in the air.

2013
03:36:31,420 --> 03:36:32,260
Night came.

2014
03:36:32,779 --> 03:36:39,400
The moon was entering her first quarter, and her insufficient light would soon die out in the mist on the horizon.

2015
03:36:40,279 --> 03:36:44,841
Clouds were rising from the east, and already overcast a part of the heavens.

2016
03:36:45,779 --> 03:37:00,680
The pilot had hung out his lights, which was very necessary in these seas crowded with vessels bound landward; for collisions are not uncommon occurrences, and, at the speed she was going, the least shock would shatter the gallant little craft.

2017
03:37:01,759 --> 03:37:05,060
Fix, seated in the bow, gave himself up to meditation.

2018
03:37:05,681 --> 03:37:14,921
He kept apart from his fellow-travellers, knowing Mr. Fogg's taciturn tastes; besides, he did not quite like to talk to the man whose favours he had accepted.

2019
03:37:15,579 --> 03:37:17,381
He was thinking, too, of the future.

2020
03:37:17,979 --> 03:37:29,500
It seemed certain that Fogg would not stop at Yokohama, but would at once take the boat for San Francisco; and the vast extent of America would ensure him impunity and safety.

2021
03:37:30,461 --> 03:37:33,200
Fogg's plan appeared to him the simplest in the world.

2022
03:37:33,740 --> 03:37:51,540
Instead of sailing directly from England to the United States, like a common villain, he had traversed three quarters of the globe, so as to gain the American continent more surely; and there, after throwing the police off his track, he would quietly enjoy himself with the fortune stolen from the bank.

2023
03:37:52,620 --> 03:37:55,800
But, once in the United States, what should he, Fix, do?

2024
03:37:56,500 --> 03:37:58,680
Should he abandon this man?

2025
03:37:58,700 --> 03:38:00,541
No, a hundred times no!

2026
03:38:01,080 --> 03:38:05,140
Until he had secured his extradition, he would not lose sight of him for an hour.

2027
03:38:05,880 --> 03:38:08,940
It was his duty, and he would fulfil it to the end.

2028
03:38:09,940 --> 03:38:23,699
At all events, there was one thing to be thankful for; Passepartout was not with his master; and it was above all important, after the confidences Fix had imparted to him, that the servant should never have speech with his master.

2029
03:38:24,979 --> 03:38:30,180
Phileas Fogg was also thinking of Passepartout, who had so strangely disappeared.

2030
03:38:30,939 --> 03:38:47,721
Looking at the matter from every point of view, it did not seem to him impossible that, by some mistake, the man might have embarked on the Carnatic at the last moment; and this was also Aouda's opinion, who regretted very much the loss of the worthy fellow to whom she owed so much.

2031
03:38:48,520 --> 03:38:56,600
They might then find him at Yokohama; for, if the Carnatic was carrying him thither, it would be easy to ascertain if he had been on board.

2032
03:38:57,820 --> 03:39:09,280
A brisk breeze arose about ten o'clock; but, though it might have been prudent to take in a reef, the pilot, after carefully examining the heavens, let the craft remain rigged as before.

2033
03:39:10,660 --> 03:39:18,601
The Tankadere bore sail admirably, as she drew a great deal of water, and everything was prepared for high speed in case of a gale.

2034
03:39:19,920 --> 03:39:28,301
Mr. Fogg and Aouda descended into the cabin at midnight, having been already preceded by Fix, who had lain down on one of the cots.

2035
03:39:29,000 --> 03:39:31,700
The pilot and crew remained on deck all night.

2036
03:39:32,760 --> 03:39:39,381
At sunrise the next day, which was 8th November, the boat had made more than one hundred miles.

2037
03:39:39,461 --> 03:39:44,600
The log indicated a mean speed of between eight and nine miles.

2038
03:39:45,359 --> 03:39:50,760
The Tankadere still carried all sail, and was accomplishing her greatest capacity of speed.

2039
03:39:51,700 --> 03:39:55,659
If the wind held as it was, the chances would be in her favour.

2040
03:39:56,460 --> 03:40:07,900
During the day she kept along the coast, where the currents were favourable; the coast, irregular in profile, and visible sometimes across the clearings, was at most five miles distant.

2041
03:40:08,700 --> 03:40:19,520
The sea was less boisterous, since the wind came off land--a fortunate circumstance for the boat, which would suffer, owing to its small tonnage, by a heavy surge on the sea.

2042
03:40:20,240 --> 03:40:25,120
The breeze subsided a little towards noon, and set in from the south-west.

2043
03:40:25,680 --> 03:40:31,820
The pilot put up his poles, but took them down again within two hours, as the wind freshened up anew.

2044
03:40:33,080 --> 03:40:44,921
Mr. Fogg and Aouda, happily unaffected by the roughness of the sea, ate with a good appetite, Fix being invited to share their repast, which he accepted with secret chagrin.

2045
03:40:46,060 --> 03:40:51,540
To travel at this man's expense and live upon his provisions was not palatable to him.

2046
03:40:52,279 --> 03:40:54,960
Still, he was obliged to eat, and so he ate.

2047
03:40:55,640 --> 03:41:10,279
When the meal was over, he took Mr. Fogg apart, and said, "sir"--this "sir" scorched his lips, and he had to control himself to avoid collaring this "gentleman"--"sir, you have been very kind to give me a passage on this boat.

2048
03:41:10,760 --> 03:41:16,760
But, though my means will not admit of my expending them as freely as you, I must ask to pay my share--"

2049
03:41:17,680 --> 03:41:20,439
"Let us not speak of that, sir," replied Mr. Fogg.

2050
03:41:21,340 --> 03:41:22,241
"But, if I insist--"

2051
03:41:22,860 --> 03:41:27,580
"No, sir," repeated Mr. Fogg, in a tone which did not admit of a reply.

2052
03:41:28,199 --> 03:41:30,760
"This enters into my general expenses."

2053
03:41:31,500 --> 03:41:39,840
Fix, as he bowed, had a stifled feeling, and, going forward, where he ensconced himself, did not open his mouth for the rest of the day.

2054
03:41:41,200 --> 03:41:45,780
Meanwhile they were progressing famously, and John Bunsby was in high hope.

2055
03:41:46,500 --> 03:41:53,419
He several times assured Mr. Fogg that they would reach Shanghai in time; to which that gentleman responded that he counted upon it.

2056
03:41:54,221 --> 03:41:58,380
The crew set to work in good earnest, inspired by the reward to be gained.

2057
03:41:59,180 --> 03:42:07,779
There was not a sheet which was not tightened, not a sail which was not vigorously hoisted; not a lurch could be charged to the man at the helm.

2058
03:42:08,280 --> 03:42:12,421
They worked as desperately as if they were contesting in a Royal yacht regatta.

2059
03:42:13,860 --> 03:42:32,760
By evening, the log showed that two hundred and twenty miles had been accomplished from Hong Kong, and Mr. Fogg might hope that he would be able to reach Yokohama without recording any delay in his journal; in which case, the many misadventures which had overtaken him since he left London would not seriously affect his journey.

2060
03:42:33,880 --> 03:42:43,899
The Tankadere entered the Straits of Fo-Kien, which separate the island of Formosa from the Chinese coast, in the small hours of the night, and crossed the Tropic of Cancer.

2061
03:42:44,760 --> 03:42:55,520
The sea was very rough in the straits, full of eddies formed by the counter-currents, and the chopping waves broke her course, whilst it became very difficult to stand on deck.

2062
03:42:57,000 --> 03:43:02,560
At daybreak the wind began to blow hard again, and the heavens seemed to predict a gale.

2063
03:43:03,160 --> 03:43:14,180
The barometer announced a speedy change, the mercury rising and falling capriciously; the sea also, in the south-east, raised long surges which indicated a tempest.

2064
03:43:14,780 --> 03:43:21,580
The sun had set the evening before in a red mist, in the midst of the phosphorescent scintillations of the ocean.

2065
03:43:22,721 --> 03:43:29,940
John Bunsby long examined the threatening aspect of the heavens, muttering indistinctly between his teeth.

2066
03:43:29,961 --> 03:43:34,440
At last he said in a low voice to Mr. Fogg, "Shall I speak out to your honour?"

2067
03:43:35,320 --> 03:43:36,120
"Of course."

2068
03:43:36,780 --> 03:43:38,680
"Well, we are going to have a squall."

2069
03:43:39,680 --> 03:43:41,420
"Is the wind north or south?"

2070
03:43:41,779 --> 03:43:43,120
asked Mr. Fogg quietly.

2071
03:43:43,779 --> 03:43:44,320
"South.

2072
03:43:44,561 --> 03:43:45,020
Look!

2073
03:43:45,041 --> 03:43:46,200
a typhoon is coming up."

2074
03:43:47,180 --> 03:43:50,680
"Glad it's a typhoon from the south, for it will carry us forward."

2075
03:43:51,341 --> 03:43:55,561
"Oh, if you take it that way," said John Bunsby, "I've nothing more to say."

2076
03:43:56,600 --> 03:43:59,520
John Bunsby's suspicions were confirmed.

2077
03:43:59,540 --> 03:44:14,460
At a less advanced season of the year the typhoon, according to a famous meteorologist, would have passed away like a luminous cascade of electric flame; but in the winter equinox it was to be feared that it would burst upon them with great violence.

2078
03:44:15,499 --> 03:44:17,840
The pilot took his precautions in advance.

2079
03:44:18,180 --> 03:44:24,080
He reefed all sail, the pole-masts were dispensed with; all hands went forward to the bows.

2080
03:44:24,479 --> 03:44:31,800
A single triangular sail, of strong canvas, was hoisted as a storm-jib, so as to hold the wind from behind.

2081
03:44:32,400 --> 03:44:33,419
Then they waited.

2082
03:44:34,280 --> 03:44:45,841
John Bunsby had requested his passengers to go below; but this imprisonment in so narrow a space, with little air, and the boat bouncing in the gale, was far from pleasant.

2083
03:44:46,600 --> 03:44:50,840
Neither Mr. Fogg, Fix, nor Aouda consented to leave the deck.

2084
03:44:51,601 --> 03:44:55,240
The storm of rain and wind descended upon them towards eight o'clock.

2085
03:44:55,960 --> 03:45:03,561
With but its bit of sail, the Tankadere was lifted like a feather by a wind, an idea of whose violence can scarcely be given.

2086
03:45:04,280 --> 03:45:10,780
To compare her speed to four times that of a locomotive going on full steam would be below the truth.

2087
03:45:11,580 --> 03:45:21,120
The boat scudded thus northward during the whole day, borne on by monstrous waves, preserving always, fortunately, a speed equal to theirs.

2088
03:45:21,681 --> 03:45:30,440
Twenty times she seemed almost to be submerged by these mountains of water which rose behind her; but the adroit management of the pilot saved her.

2089
03:45:31,101 --> 03:45:36,301
The passengers were often bathed in spray, but they submitted to it philosophically.

2090
03:45:37,120 --> 03:45:47,939
Fix cursed it, no doubt; but Aouda, with her eyes fastened upon her protector, whose coolness amazed her, showed herself worthy of him, and bravely weathered the storm.

2091
03:45:48,720 --> 03:45:53,740
As for Phileas Fogg, it seemed just as if the typhoon were a part of his programme.

2092
03:45:55,100 --> 03:46:04,300
Up to this time the Tankadere had always held her course to the north; but towards evening the wind, veering three quarters, bore down from the north-west.

2093
03:46:04,859 --> 03:46:12,240
The boat, now lying in the trough of the waves, shook and rolled terribly; the sea struck her with fearful violence.

2094
03:46:12,601 --> 03:46:15,300
At night the tempest increased in violence.

2095
03:46:15,640 --> 03:46:21,220
John Bunsby saw the approach of darkness and the rising of the storm with dark misgivings.

2096
03:46:21,900 --> 03:46:26,761
He thought awhile, and then asked his crew if it was not time to slacken speed.

2097
03:46:27,500 --> 03:46:35,620
After a consultation he approached Mr. Fogg, and said, "I think, your honour, that we should do well to make for one of the ports on the coast."

2098
03:46:36,340 --> 03:46:37,600
"I think so too."

2099
03:46:38,301 --> 03:46:38,680
"Ah!"

2100
03:46:38,880 --> 03:46:39,460
said the pilot.

2101
03:46:40,060 --> 03:46:40,920
"But which one?"

2102
03:46:41,840 --> 03:46:45,300
"I know of but one," returned Mr. Fogg tranquilly.

2103
03:46:45,860 --> 03:46:46,819
"And that is--"

2104
03:46:47,341 --> 03:46:48,120
"Shanghai."

2105
03:46:49,220 --> 03:46:55,860
The pilot, at first, did not seem to comprehend; he could scarcely realise so much determination and tenacity.

2106
03:46:56,520 --> 03:46:58,881
Then he cried, "Well--yes!

2107
03:46:59,180 --> 03:47:00,460
Your honour is right.

2108
03:47:01,100 --> 03:47:01,920
To Shanghai!"

2109
03:47:02,900 --> 03:47:05,960
So the Tankadere kept steadily on her northward track.

2110
03:47:07,181 --> 03:47:11,720
The night was really terrible; it would be a miracle if the craft did not founder.

2111
03:47:12,340 --> 03:47:17,420
Twice it could have been all over with her if the crew had not been constantly on the watch.

2112
03:47:17,439 --> 03:47:20,560
Aouda was exhausted, but did not utter a complaint.

2113
03:47:21,320 --> 03:47:25,720
More than once Mr. Fogg rushed to protect her from the violence of the waves.

2114
03:47:26,841 --> 03:47:27,860
Day reappeared.

2115
03:47:28,221 --> 03:47:34,180
The tempest still raged with undiminished fury; but the wind now returned to the south-east.

2116
03:47:34,819 --> 03:47:47,660
It was a favourable change, and the Tankadere again bounded forward on this mountainous sea, though the waves crossed each other, and imparted shocks and counter-shocks which would have crushed a craft less solidly built.

2117
03:47:48,400 --> 03:47:53,721
From time to time the coast was visible through the broken mist, but no vessel was in sight.

2118
03:47:54,461 --> 03:47:56,700
The Tankadere was alone upon the sea.

2119
03:47:57,779 --> 03:48:04,740
There were some signs of a calm at noon, and these became more distinct as the sun descended toward the horizon.

2120
03:48:05,220 --> 03:48:07,400
The tempest had been as brief as terrific.

2121
03:48:07,960 --> 03:48:12,939
The passengers, thoroughly exhausted, could now eat a little, and take some repose.

2122
03:48:14,101 --> 03:48:15,860
The night was comparatively quiet.

2123
03:48:16,400 --> 03:48:20,840
Some of the sails were again hoisted, and the speed of the boat was very good.

2124
03:48:21,439 --> 03:48:29,561
The next morning at dawn they espied the coast, and John Bunsby was able to assert that they were not one hundred miles from Shanghai.

2125
03:48:30,000 --> 03:48:33,239
A hundred miles, and only one day to traverse them!

2126
03:48:33,899 --> 03:48:39,780
That very evening Mr. Fogg was due at Shanghai, if he did not wish to miss the steamer to Yokohama.

2127
03:48:40,459 --> 03:48:47,899
Had there been no storm, during which several hours were lost, they would be at this moment within thirty miles of their destination.

2128
03:48:48,979 --> 03:48:53,520
The wind grew decidedly calmer, and happily the sea fell with it.

2129
03:48:53,539 --> 03:48:59,659
All sails were now hoisted, and at noon the Tankadere was within forty-five miles of Shanghai.

2130
03:49:00,340 --> 03:49:03,959
There remained yet six hours in which to accomplish that distance.

2131
03:49:04,600 --> 03:49:13,360
All on board feared that it could not be done, and every one--Phileas Fogg, no doubt, excepted--felt his heart beat with impatience.

2132
03:49:13,939 --> 03:49:20,419
The boat must keep up an average of nine miles an hour, and the wind was becoming calmer every moment!

2133
03:49:20,439 --> 03:49:26,580
It was a capricious breeze, coming from the coast, and after it passed the sea became smooth.

2134
03:49:26,580 --> 03:49:40,061
Still, the Tankadere was so light, and her fine sails caught the fickle zephyrs so well, that, with the aid of the currents John Bunsby found himself at six o'clock not more than ten miles from the mouth of Shanghai River.

2135
03:49:41,220 --> 03:49:45,420
Shanghai itself is situated at least twelve miles up the stream.

2136
03:49:45,980 --> 03:49:48,979
At seven they were still three miles from Shanghai.

2137
03:49:49,460 --> 03:49:55,681
The pilot swore an angry oath; the reward of two hundred pounds was evidently on the point of escaping him.

2138
03:49:56,539 --> 03:49:57,700
He looked at Mr. Fogg.

2139
03:49:58,200 --> 03:50:04,119
Mr. Fogg was perfectly tranquil; and yet his whole fortune was at this moment at stake.

2140
03:50:05,160 --> 03:50:11,439
At this moment, also, a long black funnel, crowned with wreaths of smoke, appeared on the edge of the waters.

2141
03:50:12,040 --> 03:50:17,479
It was the American steamer, leaving for Yokohama at the appointed time.

2142
03:50:17,659 --> 03:50:18,140
"Confound her!"

2143
03:50:18,740 --> 03:50:22,060
cried John Bunsby, pushing back the rudder with a desperate jerk.

2144
03:50:22,779 --> 03:50:23,620
"Signal her!"

2145
03:50:24,020 --> 03:50:25,520
said Phileas Fogg quietly.

2146
03:50:26,280 --> 03:50:32,100
A small brass cannon stood on the forward deck of the Tankadere, for making signals in the fogs.

2147
03:50:32,459 --> 03:50:41,340
It was loaded to the muzzle; but just as the pilot was about to apply a red-hot coal to the touchhole, Mr. Fogg said, "Hoist your flag!"

2148
03:50:42,000 --> 03:50:53,660
The flag was run up at half-mast, and, this being the signal of distress, it was hoped that the American steamer, perceiving it, would change her course a little, so as to succour the pilot-boat.

2149
03:50:54,280 --> 03:50:54,699
"Fire!"

2150
03:50:55,080 --> 03:50:56,360
said Mr. Fogg.

2151
03:50:56,380 --> 03:50:59,260
And the booming of the little cannon resounded in the air.

2152
03:50:59,980 --> 03:51:03,261

Around the World in Eighty Days

Chapter 22

2158
03:51:25,600 --> 03:51:33,410
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT FINDS OUT THAT, EVEN AT THE ANTIPODES, IT IS CONVENIENT TO HAVE SOME MONEY IN ONE'S POCKET

2159
03:51:34,081 --> 03:51:42,301
The Carnatic, setting sail from Hong Kong at half-past six on the 7th of November, directed her course at full steam towards Japan.

2160
03:51:43,041 --> 03:51:46,899
She carried a large cargo and a well-filled cabin of passengers.

2161
03:51:47,480 --> 03:51:53,880
Two state-rooms in the rear were, however, unoccupied--those which had been engaged by Phileas Fogg.

2162
03:51:54,900 --> 03:52:05,720
The next day a passenger with a half-stupefied eye, staggering gait, and disordered hair, was seen to emerge from the second cabin, and to totter to a seat on deck.

2163
03:52:06,500 --> 03:52:19,860
It was Passepartout; and what had happened to him was as follows: Shortly after Fix left the opium den, two waiters had lifted the unconscious Passepartout, and had carried him to the bed reserved for the smokers.

2164
03:52:20,660 --> 03:52:29,579
Three hours later, pursued even in his dreams by a fixed idea, the poor fellow awoke, and struggled against the stupefying influence of the narcotic.

2165
03:52:30,140 --> 03:52:35,920
The thought of a duty unfulfilled shook off his torpor, and he hurried from the abode of drunkenness.

2166
03:52:36,279 --> 03:52:48,060
Staggering and holding himself up by keeping against the walls, falling down and creeping up again, and irresistibly impelled by a kind of instinct, he kept crying out, "The Carnatic!

2167
03:52:48,260 --> 03:52:49,020
the Carnatic!"

2168
03:52:49,540 --> 03:52:53,200
The steamer lay puffing alongside the quay, on the point of starting.

2169
03:52:53,920 --> 03:53:02,920
Passepartout had but few steps to go; and, rushing upon the plank, he crossed it, and fell unconscious on the deck, just as the Carnatic was moving off.

2170
03:53:03,600 --> 03:53:15,900
Several sailors, who were evidently accustomed to this sort of scene, carried the poor Frenchman down into the second cabin, and Passepartout did not wake until they were one hundred and fifty miles away from China.

2171
03:53:16,540 --> 03:53:23,660
Thus he found himself the next morning on the deck of the Carnatic, and eagerly inhaling the exhilarating sea-breeze.

2172
03:53:23,961 --> 03:53:25,220
The pure air sobered him.

2173
03:53:25,580 --> 03:53:35,800
He began to collect his sense, which he found a difficult task; but at last he recalled the events of the evening before, Fix's revelation, and the opium-house.

2174
03:53:36,520 --> 03:53:40,860
"It is evident," said he to himself, "that I have been abominably drunk!

2175
03:53:41,439 --> 03:53:42,819
What will Mr. Fogg say?

2176
03:53:43,360 --> 03:53:47,260
At least I have not missed the steamer, which is the most important thing."

2177
03:53:48,280 --> 03:53:58,020
Then, as Fix occurred to him: "As for that rascal, I hope we are well rid of him, and that he has not dared, as he proposed, to follow us on board the Carnatic.

2178
03:53:58,580 --> 03:54:03,199
A detective on the track of Mr. Fogg, accused of robbing the Bank of England!

2179
03:54:03,500 --> 03:54:03,960
Pshaw!

2180
03:54:04,440 --> 03:54:07,761
Mr. Fogg is no more a robber than I am a murderer."

2181
03:54:08,580 --> 03:54:11,580
Should he divulge Fix's real errand to his master?

2182
03:54:12,141 --> 03:54:14,920
Would it do to tell the part the detective was playing?

2183
03:54:15,660 --> 03:54:26,860
Would it not be better to wait until Mr. Fogg reached London again, and then impart to him that an agent of the metropolitan police had been following him round the world, and have a good laugh over it?

2184
03:54:27,640 --> 03:54:30,261
No doubt; at least, it was worth considering.

2185
03:54:31,100 --> 03:54:36,500
The first thing to do was to find Mr. Fogg, and apologise for his singular behaviour.

2186
03:54:37,680 --> 03:54:43,500
Passepartout got up and proceeded, as well as he could with the rolling of the steamer, to the after-deck.

2187
03:54:44,279 --> 03:54:47,840
He saw no one who resembled either his master or Aouda.

2188
03:54:48,459 --> 03:54:48,840
"Good!"

2189
03:54:49,279 --> 03:54:55,280
muttered he; "Aouda has not got up yet, and Mr. Fogg has probably found some partners at whist."

2190
03:54:56,180 --> 03:54:57,580
He descended to the saloon.

2191
03:54:58,120 --> 03:54:59,619
Mr. Fogg was not there.

2192
03:55:00,300 --> 03:55:04,780
Passepartout had only, however, to ask the purser the number of his master's state-room.

2193
03:55:05,500 --> 03:55:09,641
The purser replied that he did not know any passenger by the name of Fogg.

2194
03:55:10,319 --> 03:55:13,200
"I beg your pardon," said Passepartout persistently.

2195
03:55:13,681 --> 03:55:18,580
"He is a tall gentleman, quiet, and not very talkative, and has with him a young lady--"

2196
03:55:19,279 --> 03:55:22,859
"There is no young lady on board," interrupted the purser.

2197
03:55:23,160 --> 03:55:26,820
"Here is a list of the passengers; you may see for yourself."

2198
03:55:27,720 --> 03:55:32,100
Passepartout scanned the list, but his master's name was not upon it.

2199
03:55:32,860 --> 03:55:34,460
All at once an idea struck him.

2200
03:55:35,160 --> 03:55:35,580
"Ah!

2201
03:55:35,939 --> 03:55:37,100
am I on the Carnatic?"

2202
03:55:37,560 --> 03:55:38,040
"Yes."

2203
03:55:38,561 --> 03:55:39,859
"On the way to Yokohama?"

2204
03:55:40,479 --> 03:55:41,280
"Certainly."

2205
03:55:42,319 --> 03:55:49,940
Passepartout had for an instant feared that he was on the wrong boat; but, though he was really on the Carnatic, his master was not there.

2206
03:55:50,819 --> 03:55:52,900
He fell thunderstruck on a seat.

2207
03:55:52,919 --> 03:55:54,060
He saw it all now.

2208
03:55:54,479 --> 03:56:02,020
He remembered that the time of sailing had been changed, that he should have informed his master of that fact, and that he had not done so.

2209
03:56:02,699 --> 03:56:06,620
It was his fault, then, that Mr. Fogg and Aouda had missed the steamer.

2210
03:56:06,739 --> 03:56:16,860
Yes, but it was still more the fault of the traitor who, in order to separate him from his master, and detain the latter at Hong Kong, had inveigled him into getting drunk!

2211
03:56:17,619 --> 03:56:26,980
He now saw the detective's trick; and at this moment Mr. Fogg was certainly ruined, his bet was lost, and he himself perhaps arrested and imprisoned!

2212
03:56:27,800 --> 03:56:30,000
At this thought Passepartout tore his hair.

2213
03:56:30,800 --> 03:56:35,400
Ah, if Fix ever came within his reach, what a settling of accounts there would be!

2214
03:56:36,480 --> 03:56:41,900
After his first depression, Passepartout became calmer, and began to study his situation.

2215
03:56:42,700 --> 03:56:44,579
It was certainly not an enviable one.

2216
03:56:45,140 --> 03:56:49,320
He found himself on the way to Japan, and what should he do when he got there?

2217
03:56:49,340 --> 03:56:54,081
His pocket was empty; he had not a solitary shilling, not so much as a penny.

2218
03:56:54,620 --> 03:57:02,220
His passage had fortunately been paid for in advance; and he had five or six days in which to decide upon his future course.

2219
03:57:03,041 --> 03:57:08,940
He fell to at meals with an appetite, and ate for Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and himself.

2220
03:57:09,580 --> 03:57:15,399
He helped himself as generously as if Japan were a desert, where nothing to eat was to be looked for.

2221
03:57:16,800 --> 03:57:21,221
At dawn on the 13th the Carnatic entered the port of Yokohama.

2222
03:57:21,961 --> 03:57:33,301
This is an important port of call in the Pacific, where all the mail-steamers, and those carrying travellers between North America, China, Japan, and the Oriental islands put in.

2223
03:57:33,340 --> 03:57:48,220
It is situated in the bay of Yeddo, and at but a short distance from that second capital of the Japanese Empire, and the residence of the Tycoon, the civil Emperor, before the Mikado, the spiritual Emperor, absorbed his office in his own.

2224
03:57:49,360 --> 03:57:56,720
The Carnatic anchored at the quay near the custom-house, in the midst of a crowd of ships bearing the flags of all nations.

2225
03:57:57,460 --> 03:58:02,500
Passepartout went timidly ashore on this so curious territory of the Sons of the Sun.

2226
03:58:03,119 --> 03:58:09,301
He had nothing better to do than, taking chance for his guide, to wander aimlessly through the streets of Yokohama.

2227
03:58:10,221 --> 03:58:20,900
He found himself at first in a thoroughly European quarter, the houses having low fronts, and being adorned with verandas, beneath which he caught glimpses of neat peristyles.

2228
03:58:21,399 --> 03:58:30,020
This quarter occupied, with its streets, squares, docks, and warehouses, all the space between the "promontory of the Treaty" and the river.

2229
03:58:30,620 --> 03:58:41,660
Here, as at Hong Kong and Calcutta, were mixed crowds of all races, Americans and English, Chinamen and Dutchmen, mostly merchants ready to buy or sell anything.

2230
03:58:42,501 --> 03:58:48,541
The Frenchman felt himself as much alone among them as if he had dropped down in the midst of Hottentots.

2231
03:58:49,399 --> 03:58:55,499
He had, at least, one resource,--to call on the French and English consuls at Yokohama for assistance.

2232
03:58:55,979 --> 03:59:06,740
But he shrank from telling the story of his adventures, intimately connected as it was with that of his master; and, before doing so, he determined to exhaust all other means of aid.

2233
03:59:07,540 --> 03:59:17,240
As chance did not favour him in the European quarter, he penetrated that inhabited by the native Japanese, determined, if necessary, to push on to Yeddo.

2234
03:59:18,341 --> 03:59:25,340
The Japanese quarter of Yokohama is called Benten, after the goddess of the sea, who is worshipped on the islands round about.

2235
03:59:26,020 --> 04:00:00,260
There Passepartout beheld beautiful fir and cedar groves, sacred gates of a singular architecture, bridges half hid in the midst of bamboos and reeds, temples shaded by immense cedar-trees, holy retreats where were sheltered Buddhist priests and sectaries of Confucius, and interminable streets, where a perfect harvest of rose-tinted and red-cheeked children, who looked as if they had been cut out of Japanese screens, and who were playing in the midst of short-legged poodles and yellowish cats, might have been gathered.

2236
04:00:01,439 --> 04:00:03,240
The streets were crowded with people.

2237
04:00:03,700 --> 04:00:38,061
Priests were passing in processions, beating their dreary tambourines; police and custom-house officers with pointed hats encrusted with lac and carrying two sabres hung to their waists; soldiers, clad in blue cotton with white stripes, and bearing guns; the Mikado's guards, enveloped in silken doubles, hauberks and coats of mail; and numbers of military folk of all ranks--for the military profession is as much respected in Japan as it is despised in China--went hither and thither in groups and pairs.

2238
04:00:38,601 --> 04:00:58,820
Passepartout saw, too, begging friars, long-robed pilgrims, and simple civilians, with their warped and jet-black hair, big heads, long busts, slender legs, short stature, and complexions varying from copper-colour to a dead white, but never yellow, like the Chinese, from whom the Japanese widely differ.

2239
04:00:59,520 --> 04:01:37,100
He did not fail to observe the curious equipages--carriages and palanquins, barrows supplied with sails, and litters made of bamboo; nor the women--whom he thought not especially handsome--who took little steps with their little feet, whereon they wore canvas shoes, straw sandals, and clogs of worked wood, and who displayed tight-looking eyes, flat chests, teeth fashionably blackened, and gowns crossed with silken scarfs, tied in an enormous knot behind an ornament which the modern Parisian ladies seem to have borrowed from the dames of Japan.

2240
04:01:38,439 --> 04:02:10,141
Passepartout wandered for several hours in the midst of this motley crowd, looking in at the windows of the rich and curious shops, the jewellery establishments glittering with quaint Japanese ornaments, the restaurants decked with streamers and banners, the tea-houses, where the odorous beverage was being drunk with saki, a liquor concocted from the fermentation of rice, and the comfortable smoking-houses, where they were puffing, not opium, which is almost unknown in Japan, but a very fine, stringy tobacco.

2241
04:02:10,961 --> 04:02:16,560
He went on till he found himself in the fields, in the midst of vast rice plantations.

2242
04:02:17,140 --> 04:02:45,520
There he saw dazzling camellias expanding themselves, with flowers which were giving forth their last colours and perfumes, not on bushes, but on trees, and within bamboo enclosures, cherry, plum, and apple trees, which the Japanese cultivate rather for their blossoms than their fruit, and which queerly-fashioned, grinning scarecrows protected from the sparrows, pigeons, ravens, and other voracious birds.

2243
04:02:45,539 --> 04:03:07,360
On the branches of the cedars were perched large eagles; amid the foliage of the weeping willows were herons, solemnly standing on one leg; and on every hand were crows, ducks, hawks, wild birds, and a multitude of cranes, which the Japanese consider sacred, and which to their minds symbolise long life and prosperity.

2244
04:03:08,440 --> 04:03:13,359
As he was strolling along, Passepartout espied some violets among the shrubs.

2245
04:03:14,000 --> 04:03:14,221
"Good!"

2246
04:03:14,601 --> 04:03:16,460
said he; "I'll have some supper."

2247
04:03:17,240 --> 04:03:20,100
But, on smelling them, he found that they were odourless.

2248
04:03:20,739 --> 04:03:22,560
"No chance there," thought he.

2249
04:03:23,319 --> 04:03:35,300
The worthy fellow had certainly taken good care to eat as hearty a breakfast as possible before leaving the Carnatic; but, as he had been walking about all day, the demands of hunger were becoming importunate.

2250
04:03:36,061 --> 04:04:06,040
He observed that the butchers stalls contained neither mutton, goat, nor pork; and, knowing also that it is a sacrilege to kill cattle, which are preserved solely for farming, he made up his mind that meat was far from plentiful in Yokohama--nor was he mistaken; and, in default of butcher's meat, he could have wished for a quarter of wild boar or deer, a partridge, or some quails, some game or fish, which, with rice, the Japanese eat almost exclusively.

2251
04:04:06,920 --> 04:04:13,181
But he found it necessary to keep up a stout heart, and to postpone the meal he craved till the following morning.

2252
04:04:14,420 --> 04:04:30,940
Night came, and Passepartout re-entered the native quarter, where he wandered through the streets, lit by vari-coloured lanterns, looking on at the dancers, who were executing skilful steps and boundings, and the astrologers who stood in the open air with their telescopes.

2253
04:04:31,520 --> 04:04:38,200
Then he came to the harbour, which was lit up by the resin torches of the fishermen, who were fishing from their boats.

2254
04:04:39,580 --> 04:04:54,261
The streets at last became quiet, and the patrol, the officers of which, in their splendid costumes, and surrounded by their suites, Passepartout thought seemed like ambassadors, succeeded the bustling crowd.

2255
04:04:54,279 --> 04:04:58,820
Each time a company passed, Passepartout chuckled, and said to himself: "Good!

2256
04:04:59,080 --> 04:05:03,239
another Japanese embassy departing for Europe!"

2257
04:05:03,300 --> 04:05:05,779

Around the World in Eighty Days
by
Jules Verne

2261
04:05:23,520 --> 04:05:26,779
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

2262
04:05:26,779 --> 04:05:28,689
Chapter 23

2263
04:05:28,689 --> 04:05:33,280
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT'S NOSE BECOMES OUTRAGEOUSLY LONG

2264
04:05:34,020 --> 04:05:43,180
The next morning poor, jaded, famished Passepartout said to himself that he must get something to eat at all hazards, and the sooner he did so the better.

2265
04:05:43,840 --> 04:05:48,060
He might, indeed, sell his watch; but he would have starved first.

2266
04:05:48,779 --> 04:05:54,159
Now or never he must use the strong, if not melodious voice which nature had bestowed upon him.

2267
04:05:54,560 --> 04:06:10,640
He knew several French and English songs, and resolved to try them upon the Japanese, who must be lovers of music, since they were for ever pounding on their cymbals, tam-tams, and tambourines, and could not but appreciate European talent.

2268
04:06:10,780 --> 04:06:21,740
It was, perhaps, rather early in the morning to get up a concert, and the audience prematurely aroused from their slumbers, might not possibly pay their entertainer with coin bearing the Mikado's features.

2269
04:06:22,581 --> 04:06:31,999
Passepartout therefore decided to wait several hours; and, as he was sauntering along, it occurred to him that he would seem rather too well dressed for a wandering artist.

2270
04:06:32,721 --> 04:06:42,601
The idea struck him to change his garments for clothes more in harmony with his project; by which he might also get a little money to satisfy the immediate cravings of hunger.

2271
04:06:43,421 --> 04:06:46,300
The resolution taken, it remained to carry it out.

2272
04:06:47,580 --> 04:06:55,920
It was only after a long search that Passepartout discovered a native dealer in old clothes, to whom he applied for an exchange.

2273
04:06:56,501 --> 04:07:07,760
The man liked the European costume, and ere long Passepartout issued from his shop accoutred in an old Japanese coat, and a sort of one-sided turban, faded with long use.

2274
04:07:08,340 --> 04:07:11,660
A few small pieces of silver, moreover, jingled in his pocket.

2275
04:07:12,660 --> 04:07:12,860
"Good!"

2276
04:07:13,359 --> 04:07:13,720
thought he.

2277
04:07:14,020 --> 04:07:15,780
"I will imagine I am at the Carnival!"

2278
04:07:16,640 --> 04:07:29,080
His first care, after being thus "Japanesed," was to enter a tea-house of modest appearance, and, upon half a bird and a little rice, to breakfast like a man for whom dinner was as yet a problem to be solved.

2279
04:07:30,241 --> 04:07:34,479
"Now," thought he, when he had eaten heartily, "I mustn't lose my head.

2280
04:07:34,500 --> 04:07:38,160
I can't sell this costume again for one still more Japanese.

2281
04:07:38,580 --> 04:07:46,180
I must consider how to leave this country of the Sun, of which I shall not retain the most delightful of memories, as quickly as possible."

2282
04:07:47,260 --> 04:07:50,980
It occurred to him to visit the steamers which were about to leave for America.

2283
04:07:51,640 --> 04:07:56,260
He would offer himself as a cook or servant, in payment of his passage and meals.

2284
04:07:56,939 --> 04:08:00,740
Once at San Francisco, he would find some means of going on.

2285
04:08:01,540 --> 04:08:09,399
The difficulty was, how to traverse the four thousand seven hundred miles of the Pacific which lay between Japan and the New World.

2286
04:08:10,540 --> 04:08:16,460
Passepartout was not the man to let an idea go begging, and directed his steps towards the docks.

2287
04:08:17,041 --> 04:08:24,399
But, as he approached them, his project, which at first had seemed so simple, began to grow more and more formidable to his mind.

2288
04:08:25,240 --> 04:08:33,439
What need would they have of a cook or servant on an American steamer, and what confidence would they put in him, dressed as he was?

2289
04:08:33,979 --> 04:08:35,359
What references could he give?

2290
04:08:36,260 --> 04:08:44,340
As he was reflecting in this wise, his eyes fell upon an immense placard which a sort of clown was carrying through the streets.

2291
04:08:44,740 --> 04:08:47,880
This placard, which was in English, read as follows:

2292
04:08:48,480 --> 04:08:59,659
ACROBATIC JAPANESE TROUPE, HONOURABLE WILLIAM BATULCAR, PROPRIETOR, LAST REPRESENTATIONS, PRIOR TO THEIR DEPARTURE TO THE UNITED STATES, OF THE LONG NOSES!

2293
04:09:00,181 --> 04:09:01,740
LONG NOSES!

2294
04:09:02,641 --> 04:09:05,359
UNDER THE DIRECT PATRONAGE OF THE GOD TINGOU!

2295
04:09:06,060 --> 04:09:07,040
GREAT ATTRACTION!

2296
04:09:08,240 --> 04:09:09,660
"The United States!"

2297
04:09:09,780 --> 04:09:12,600
said Passepartout; "that's just what I want!"

2298
04:09:13,620 --> 04:09:17,579
He followed the clown, and soon found himself once more in the Japanese quarter.

2299
04:09:18,360 --> 04:09:32,220
A quarter of an hour later he stopped before a large cabin, adorned with several clusters of streamers, the exterior walls of which were designed to represent, in violent colours and without perspective, a company of jugglers.

2300
04:09:32,841 --> 04:09:35,640
This was the Honourable William Batulcar's establishment.

2301
04:09:36,280 --> 04:09:53,640
That gentleman was a sort of Barnum, the director of a troupe of mountebanks, jugglers, clowns, acrobats, equilibrists, and gymnasts, who, according to the placard, was giving his last performances before leaving the Empire of the Sun for the States of the Union.

2302
04:09:54,860 --> 04:09:59,700
Passepartout entered and asked for Mr. Batulcar, who straightway appeared in person.

2303
04:10:00,520 --> 04:10:01,641
"What do you want?"

2304
04:10:01,939 --> 04:10:04,859
said he to Passepartout, whom he at first took for a native.

2305
04:10:05,520 --> 04:10:07,221
"Would you like a servant, sir?"

2306
04:10:07,239 --> 04:10:08,120
asked Passepartout.

2307
04:10:08,699 --> 04:10:09,681
"A servant!"

2308
04:10:10,040 --> 04:10:14,479
cried Mr. Batulcar, caressing the thick grey beard which hung from his chin.

2309
04:10:15,081 --> 04:10:30,141
"I already have two who are obedient and faithful, have never left me, and serve me for their nourishment and here they are," added he, holding out his two robust arms, furrowed with veins as large as the strings of a bass-viol.

2310
04:10:30,920 --> 04:10:32,840
"So I can be of no use to you?"

2311
04:10:33,461 --> 04:10:34,001
"None."

2312
04:10:34,641 --> 04:10:35,641
"The devil!

2313
04:10:35,659 --> 04:10:37,759
I should so like to cross the Pacific with you!"

2314
04:10:38,381 --> 04:10:38,800
"Ah!"

2315
04:10:39,120 --> 04:10:40,699
said the Honourable Mr. Batulcar.

2316
04:10:41,260 --> 04:10:44,020
"You are no more a Japanese than I am a monkey!

2317
04:10:44,601 --> 04:10:46,180
Who are you dressed up in that way?"

2318
04:10:46,840 --> 04:10:48,780
"A man dresses as he can."

2319
04:10:49,399 --> 04:10:50,181
"That's true.

2320
04:10:50,840 --> 04:10:52,140
You are a Frenchman, aren't you?"

2321
04:10:53,039 --> 04:10:54,880
"Yes; a Parisian of Paris."

2322
04:10:55,520 --> 04:10:57,840
"Then you ought to know how to make grimaces?"

2323
04:10:58,421 --> 04:11:10,121
"Why," replied Passepartout, a little vexed that his nationality should cause this question, "we Frenchmen know how to make grimaces, it is true but not any better than the Americans do."

2324
04:11:10,761 --> 04:11:11,080
"True.

2325
04:11:11,800 --> 04:11:15,400
Well, if I can't take you as a servant, I can as a clown.

2326
04:11:16,141 --> 04:11:22,721
You see, my friend, in France they exhibit foreign clowns, and in foreign parts French clowns."

2327
04:11:23,260 --> 04:11:23,659
"Ah!"

2328
04:11:24,240 --> 04:11:25,700
"You are pretty strong, eh?"

2329
04:11:26,160 --> 04:11:28,060
"Especially after a good meal."

2330
04:11:28,681 --> 04:11:30,200
"And you can sing?"

2331
04:11:30,780 --> 04:11:35,500
"Yes," returned Passepartout, who had formerly been wont to sing in the streets.

2332
04:11:36,261 --> 04:11:43,841
"But can you sing standing on your head, with a top spinning on your left foot, and a sabre balanced on your right?"

2333
04:11:44,640 --> 04:11:44,940
"Humph!

2334
04:11:45,580 --> 04:11:50,620
I think so," replied Passepartout, recalling the exercises of his younger days.

2335
04:11:51,180 --> 04:11:54,659
"Well, that's enough," said the Honourable William Batulcar.

2336
04:11:55,280 --> 04:11:57,720
The engagement was concluded there and then.

2337
04:11:59,000 --> 04:12:01,540
Passepartout had at last found something to do.

2338
04:12:02,200 --> 04:12:05,320
He was engaged to act in the celebrated Japanese troupe.

2339
04:12:05,920 --> 04:12:11,900
It was not a very dignified position, but within a week he would be on his way to San Francisco.

2340
04:12:13,340 --> 04:12:24,600
The performance, so noisily announced by the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, was to commence at three o'clock, and soon the deafening instruments of a Japanese orchestra resounded at the door.

2341
04:12:25,240 --> 04:12:39,479
Passepartout, though he had not been able to study or rehearse a part, was designated to lend the aid of his sturdy shoulders in the great exhibition of the "human pyramid," executed by the Long Noses of the god Tingou.

2342
04:12:40,240 --> 04:12:43,381
This "great attraction" was to close the performance.

2343
04:12:44,440 --> 04:12:59,800
Before three o'clock the large shed was invaded by the spectators, comprising Europeans and natives, Chinese and Japanese, men, women and children, who precipitated themselves upon the narrow benches and into the boxes opposite the stage.

2344
04:13:00,540 --> 04:13:10,640
The musicians took up a position inside, and were vigorously performing on their gongs, tam-tams, flutes, bones, tambourines, and immense drums.

2345
04:13:11,140 --> 04:13:19,480
The performance was much like all acrobatic displays; but it must be confessed that the Japanese are the first equilibrists in the world.

2346
04:13:20,200 --> 04:13:44,279
One, with a fan and some bits of paper, performed the graceful trick of the butterflies and the flowers; another traced in the air, with the odorous smoke of his pipe, a series of blue words, which composed a compliment to the audience; while a third juggled with some lighted candles, which he extinguished successively as they passed his lips, and relit again without interrupting for an instant his juggling.

2347
04:13:45,001 --> 04:14:14,580
Another reproduced the most singular combinations with a spinning-top; in his hands the revolving tops seemed to be animated with a life of their own in their interminable whirling; they ran over pipe-stems, the edges of sabres, wires and even hairs stretched across the stage; they turned around on the edges of large glasses, crossed bamboo ladders, dispersed into all the corners, and produced strange musical effects by the combination of their various pitches of tone.

2348
04:14:15,300 --> 04:14:26,501
The jugglers tossed them in the air, threw them like shuttlecocks with wooden battledores, and yet they kept on spinning; they put them into their pockets, and took them out still whirling as before.

2349
04:14:27,260 --> 04:14:32,100
It is useless to describe the astonishing performances of the acrobats and gymnasts.

2350
04:14:32,420 --> 04:14:39,260
The turning on ladders, poles, balls, barrels, &c., was executed with wonderful precision.

2351
04:14:39,940 --> 04:14:47,100
But the principal attraction was the exhibition of the Long Noses, a show to which Europe is as yet a stranger.

2352
04:14:47,939 --> 04:14:53,480
The Long Noses form a peculiar company, under the direct patronage of the god Tingou.

2353
04:14:54,260 --> 04:15:08,360
Attired after the fashion of the Middle Ages, they bore upon their shoulders a splendid pair of wings; but what especially distinguished them was the long noses which were fastened to their faces, and the uses which they made of them.

2354
04:15:09,119 --> 04:15:20,261
These noses were made of bamboo, and were five, six, and even ten feet long, some straight, others curved, some ribboned, and some having imitation warts upon them.

2355
04:15:21,001 --> 04:15:28,400
It was upon these appendages, fixed tightly on their real noses, that they performed their gymnastic exercises.

2356
04:15:29,340 --> 04:15:44,840
A dozen of these sectaries of Tingou lay flat upon their backs, while others, dressed to represent lightning-rods, came and frolicked on their noses, jumping from one to another, and performing the most skilful leapings and somersaults.

2357
04:15:45,860 --> 04:15:54,240
As a last scene, a "human pyramid" had been announced, in which fifty Long Noses were to represent the Car of Juggernaut.

2358
04:15:54,859 --> 04:16:02,560
But, instead of forming a pyramid by mounting each other's shoulders, the artists were to group themselves on top of the noses.

2359
04:16:03,040 --> 04:16:16,820
It happened that the performer who had hitherto formed the base of the Car had quitted the troupe, and as, to fill this part, only strength and adroitness were necessary, Passepartout had been chosen to take his place.

2360
04:16:17,699 --> 04:16:31,200
The poor fellow really felt sad when--melancholy reminiscence of his youth!--he donned his costume, adorned with vari-coloured wings, and fastened to his natural feature a false nose six feet long.

2361
04:16:31,820 --> 04:16:35,800
But he cheered up when he thought that this nose was winning him something to eat.

2362
04:16:36,619 --> 04:16:42,600
He went upon the stage, and took his place beside the rest who were to compose the base of the Car of Juggernaut.

2363
04:16:43,240 --> 04:16:47,860
They all stretched themselves on the floor, their noses pointing to the ceiling.

2364
04:16:48,740 --> 04:17:01,859
A second group of artists disposed themselves on these long appendages, then a third above these, then a fourth, until a human monument reaching to the very cornices of the theatre soon arose on top of the noses.

2365
04:17:02,620 --> 04:17:18,680
This elicited loud applause, in the midst of which the orchestra was just striking up a deafening air, when the pyramid tottered, the balance was lost, one of the lower noses vanished from the pyramid, and the human monument was shattered like a castle built of cards!

2366
04:17:19,280 --> 04:17:20,800
It was Passepartout's fault.

2367
04:17:21,280 --> 04:17:33,700
Abandoning his position, clearing the footlights without the aid of his wings, and, clambering up to the right-hand gallery, he fell at the feet of one of the spectators, crying, "Ah, my master!

2368
04:17:34,000 --> 04:17:34,800
my master!"

2369
04:17:36,221 --> 04:17:36,419
"You here?"

2370
04:17:37,239 --> 04:17:38,260
"Myself."

2371
04:17:38,840 --> 04:17:42,020
"Very well; then let us go to the steamer, young man!"

2372
04:17:43,020 --> 04:17:52,959
Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout passed through the lobby of the theatre to the outside, where they encountered the Honourable Mr. Batulcar, furious with rage.

2373
04:17:53,601 --> 04:18:01,181
He demanded damages for the "breakage" of the pyramid; and Phileas Fogg appeased him by giving him a handful of banknotes.

2374
04:18:02,561 --> 04:18:16,199
At half-past six, the very hour of departure, Mr. Fogg and Aouda, followed by Passepartout, who in his hurry had retained his wings, and nose six feet long, stepped upon the American steamer.

Chapter 24

2381
04:18:43,410 --> 04:18:48,180
DURING WHICH MR. FOGG AND PARTY CROSS THE PACIFIC OCEAN

2382
04:18:48,900 --> 04:18:53,399
What happened when the pilot-boat came in sight of Shanghai will be easily guessed.

2383
04:18:54,039 --> 04:19:04,541
The signals made by the Tankadere had been seen by the captain of the Yokohama steamer, who, espying the flag at half-mast, had directed his course towards the little craft.

2384
04:19:04,980 --> 04:19:21,680
Phileas Fogg, after paying the stipulated price of his passage to John Busby, and rewarding that worthy with the additional sum of five hundred and fifty pounds, ascended the steamer with Aouda and Fix; and they started at once for Nagasaki and Yokohama.

2385
04:19:22,760 --> 04:19:26,360
They reached their destination on the morning of the 14th of November.

2386
04:19:26,979 --> 04:19:41,280
Phileas Fogg lost no time in going on board the Carnatic, where he learned, to Aouda's great delight--and perhaps to his own, though he betrayed no emotion--that Passepartout, a Frenchman, had really arrived on her the day before.

2387
04:19:42,540 --> 04:19:50,999
The San Francisco steamer was announced to leave that very evening, and it became necessary to find Passepartout, if possible, without delay.

2388
04:19:51,760 --> 04:20:00,940
Mr. Fogg applied in vain to the French and English consuls, and, after wandering through the streets a long time, began to despair of finding his missing servant.

2389
04:20:01,761 --> 04:20:08,140
Chance, or perhaps a kind of presentiment, at last led him into the Honourable Mr. Batulcar's theatre.

2390
04:20:08,160 --> 04:20:17,740
He certainly would not have recognised Passepartout in the eccentric mountebank's costume; but the latter, lying on his back, perceived his master in the gallery.

2391
04:20:18,200 --> 04:20:25,300
He could not help starting, which so changed the position of his nose as to bring the "pyramid" pell-mell upon the stage.

2392
04:20:26,461 --> 04:20:37,640
All this Passepartout learned from Aouda, who recounted to him what had taken place on the voyage from Hong Kong to Shanghai on the Tankadere, in company with one Mr. Fix.

2393
04:20:38,240 --> 04:20:41,620
Passepartout did not change countenance on hearing this name.

2394
04:20:42,119 --> 04:20:58,900
He thought that the time had not yet arrived to divulge to his master what had taken place between the detective and himself; and, in the account he gave of his absence, he simply excused himself for having been overtaken by drunkenness, in smoking opium at a tavern in Hong Kong.

2395
04:21:00,280 --> 04:21:09,560
Mr. Fogg heard this narrative coldly, without a word; and then furnished his man with funds necessary to obtain clothing more in harmony with his position.

2396
04:21:10,300 --> 04:21:19,120
Within an hour the Frenchman had cut off his nose and parted with his wings, and retained nothing about him which recalled the sectary of the god Tingou.

2397
04:21:19,979 --> 04:21:29,380
The steamer which was about to depart from Yokohama to San Francisco belonged to the Pacific Mail Steamship Company, and was named the General Grant.

2398
04:21:30,080 --> 04:21:36,840
She was a large paddle-wheel steamer of two thousand five hundred tons; well equipped and very fast.

2399
04:21:37,520 --> 04:21:54,580
The massive walking-beam rose and fell above the deck; at one end a piston-rod worked up and down; and at the other was a connecting-rod which, in changing the rectilinear motion to a circular one, was directly connected with the shaft of the paddles.

2400
04:21:55,320 --> 04:22:03,420
The General Grant was rigged with three masts, giving a large capacity for sails, and thus materially aiding the steam power.

2401
04:22:04,319 --> 04:22:08,959
By making twelve miles an hour, she would cross the ocean in twenty-one days.

2402
04:22:09,601 --> 04:22:24,439
Phileas Fogg was therefore justified in hoping that he would reach San Francisco by the 2nd of December, New York by the 11th, and London on the 20th--thus gaining several hours on the fatal date of the 21st of December.

2403
04:22:25,920 --> 04:22:40,320
There was a full complement of passengers on board, among them English, many Americans, a large number of coolies on their way to California, and several East Indian officers, who were spending their vacation in making the tour of the world.

2404
04:22:41,660 --> 04:22:50,479
Nothing of moment happened on the voyage; the steamer, sustained on its large paddles, rolled but little, and the Pacific almost justified its name.

2405
04:22:51,399 --> 04:22:54,600
Mr. Fogg was as calm and taciturn as ever.

2406
04:22:55,160 --> 04:23:13,239
His young companion felt herself more and more attached to him by other ties than gratitude; his silent but generous nature impressed her more than she thought; and it was almost unconsciously that she yielded to emotions which did not seem to have the least effect upon her protector.

2407
04:23:14,260 --> 04:23:22,020
Aouda took the keenest interest in his plans, and became impatient at any incident which seemed likely to retard his journey.

2408
04:23:22,600 --> 04:23:35,739
She often chatted with Passepartout, who did not fail to perceive the state of the lady's heart; and, being the most faithful of domestics, he never exhausted his eulogies of Phileas Fogg's honesty, generosity, and devotion.

2409
04:23:36,500 --> 04:23:51,140
He took pains to calm Aouda's doubts of a successful termination of the journey, telling her that the most difficult part of it had passed, that now they were beyond the fantastic countries of Japan and China, and were fairly on their way to civilised places again.

2410
04:23:51,920 --> 04:24:04,980
A railway train from San Francisco to New York, and a transatlantic steamer from New York to Liverpool, would doubtless bring them to the end of this impossible journey round the world within the period agreed upon.

2411
04:24:06,420 --> 04:24:14,000
On the ninth day after leaving Yokohama, Phileas Fogg had traversed exactly one half of the terrestrial globe.

2412
04:24:14,720 --> 04:24:22,900
The General Grant passed, on the 23rd of November, the one hundred and eightieth meridian, and was at the very antipodes of London.

2413
04:24:23,819 --> 04:24:32,720
Mr. Fogg had, it is true, exhausted fifty-two of the eighty days in which he was to complete the tour, and there were only twenty-eight left.

2414
04:24:33,400 --> 04:24:50,141
But, though he was only half-way by the difference of meridians, he had really gone over two-thirds of the whole journey; for he had been obliged to make long circuits from London to Aden, from Aden to Bombay, from Calcutta to Singapore, and from Singapore to Yokohama.

2415
04:24:50,940 --> 04:25:12,721
Could he have followed without deviation the fiftieth parallel, which is that of London, the whole distance would only have been about twelve thousand miles; whereas he would be forced, by the irregular methods of locomotion, to traverse twenty-six thousand, of which he had, on the 23rd of November, accomplished seventeen thousand five hundred.

2416
04:25:12,840 --> 04:25:18,340
And now the course was a straight one, and Fix was no longer there to put obstacles in their way!

2417
04:25:19,660 --> 04:25:24,619
It happened also, on the 23rd of November, that Passepartout made a joyful discovery.

2418
04:25:25,320 --> 04:25:37,580
It will be remembered that the obstinate fellow had insisted on keeping his famous family watch at London time, and on regarding that of the countries he had passed through as quite false and unreliable.

2419
04:25:38,180 --> 04:25:45,859
Now, on this day, though he had not changed the hands, he found that his watch exactly agreed with the ship's chronometers.

2420
04:25:46,319 --> 04:25:47,839
His triumph was hilarious.

2421
04:25:48,220 --> 04:25:51,460
He would have liked to know what Fix would say if he were aboard!

2422
04:25:52,101 --> 04:25:58,860
"The rogue told me a lot of stories," repeated Passepartout, "about the meridians, the sun, and the moon!

2423
04:25:58,880 --> 04:25:59,660
Moon, indeed!

2424
04:26:00,100 --> 04:26:01,680
moonshine more likely!

2425
04:26:02,220 --> 04:26:06,301
If one listened to that sort of people, a pretty sort of time one would keep!

2426
04:26:06,920 --> 04:26:11,040
I was sure that the sun would some day regulate itself by my watch!"

2427
04:26:11,700 --> 04:26:37,420
Passepartout was ignorant that, if the face of his watch had been divided into twenty-four hours, like the Italian clocks, he would have no reason for exultation; for the hands of his watch would then, instead of as now indicating nine o'clock in the morning, indicate nine o'clock in the evening, that is, the twenty-first hour after midnight precisely the difference between London time and that of the one hundred and eightieth meridian.

2428
04:26:38,020 --> 04:26:45,700
But if Fix had been able to explain this purely physical effect, Passepartout would not have admitted, even if he had comprehended it.

2429
04:26:46,279 --> 04:26:57,301
Moreover, if the detective had been on board at that moment, Passepartout would have joined issue with him on a quite different subject, and in an entirely different manner.

2430
04:26:58,601 --> 04:27:00,180
Where was Fix at that moment?

2431
04:27:00,619 --> 04:27:03,240
He was actually on board the General Grant.

2432
04:27:04,120 --> 04:27:15,640
On reaching Yokohama, the detective, leaving Mr. Fogg, whom he expected to meet again during the day, had repaired at once to the English consulate, where he at last found the warrant of arrest.

2433
04:27:16,200 --> 04:27:22,379
It had followed him from Bombay, and had come by the Carnatic, on which steamer he himself was supposed to be.

2434
04:27:23,479 --> 04:27:28,761
Fix's disappointment may be imagined when he reflected that the warrant was now useless.

2435
04:27:29,359 --> 04:27:35,100
Mr. Fogg had left English ground, and it was now necessary to procure his extradition!

2436
04:27:36,020 --> 04:27:42,761
"Well," thought Fix, after a moment of anger, "my warrant is not good here, but it will be in England.

2437
04:27:43,779 --> 04:27:49,621
The rogue evidently intends to return to his own country, thinking he has thrown the police off his track.

2438
04:27:50,180 --> 04:27:50,500
Good!

2439
04:27:50,860 --> 04:27:52,560
I will follow him across the Atlantic.

2440
04:27:53,240 --> 04:27:55,880
As for the money, heaven grant there may be some left!

2441
04:27:56,540 --> 04:28:05,279
But the fellow has already spent in travelling, rewards, trials, bail, elephants, and all sorts of charges, more than five thousand pounds.

2442
04:28:05,860 --> 04:28:08,061
Yet, after all, the Bank is rich!"

2443
04:28:09,001 --> 04:28:15,600
His course decided on, he went on board the General Grant, and was there when Mr. Fogg and Aouda arrived.

2444
04:28:16,239 --> 04:28:21,380
To his utter amazement, he recognised Passepartout, despite his theatrical disguise.

2445
04:28:21,380 --> 04:28:32,301
He quickly concealed himself in his cabin, to avoid an awkward explanation, and hoped--thanks to the number of passengers--to remain unperceived by Mr. Fogg's servant.

2446
04:28:33,200 --> 04:28:37,720
On that very day, however, he met Passepartout face to face on the forward deck.

2447
04:28:38,680 --> 04:28:56,320
The latter, without a word, made a rush for him, grasped him by the throat, and, much to the amusement of a group of Americans, who immediately began to bet on him, administered to the detective a perfect volley of blows, which proved the great superiority of French over English pugilistic skill.

2448
04:28:57,120 --> 04:29:00,820
When Passepartout had finished, he found himself relieved and comforted.

2449
04:29:01,540 --> 04:29:08,819
Fix got up in a somewhat rumpled condition, and, looking at his adversary, coldly said, "Have you done?"

2450
04:29:09,780 --> 04:29:11,261
"For this time--yes."

2451
04:29:11,939 --> 04:29:13,500
"Then let me have a word with you."

2452
04:29:14,181 --> 04:29:14,540
"But I--"

2453
04:29:15,040 --> 04:29:16,661
"In your master's interests."

2454
04:29:17,620 --> 04:29:25,720
Passepartout seemed to be vanquished by Fix's coolness, for he quietly followed him, and they sat down aside from the rest of the passengers.

2455
04:29:26,460 --> 04:29:28,620
"You have given me a thrashing," said Fix.

2456
04:29:29,181 --> 04:29:30,580
"Good, I expected it.

2457
04:29:31,201 --> 04:29:32,260
Now, listen to me.

2458
04:29:32,820 --> 04:29:35,699
Up to this time I have been Mr. Fogg's adversary.

2459
04:29:36,280 --> 04:29:37,780
I am now in his game."

2460
04:29:38,940 --> 04:29:39,400
"Aha!"

2461
04:29:39,840 --> 04:29:43,061
cried Passepartout; "you are convinced he is an honest man?"

2462
04:29:43,620 --> 04:29:47,641
"No," replied Fix coldly, "I think him a rascal.

2463
04:29:48,260 --> 04:29:48,500
Sh!

2464
04:29:48,760 --> 04:29:50,460
don't budge, and let me speak.

2465
04:29:51,400 --> 04:29:59,880
As long as Mr. Fogg was on English ground, it was for my interest to detain him there until my warrant of arrest arrived.

2466
04:29:59,900 --> 04:30:02,181
I did everything I could to keep him back.

2467
04:30:02,760 --> 04:30:11,720
I sent the Bombay priests after him, I got you intoxicated at Hong Kong, I separated you from him, and I made him miss the Yokohama steamer."

2468
04:30:12,400 --> 04:30:14,780
Passepartout listened, with closed fists.

2469
04:30:15,420 --> 04:30:19,420
"Now," resumed Fix, "Mr. Fogg seems to be going back to England.

2470
04:30:19,960 --> 04:30:21,460
Well, I will follow him there.

2471
04:30:22,000 --> 04:30:28,860
But hereafter I will do as much to keep obstacles out of his way as I have done up to this time to put them in his path.

2472
04:30:29,580 --> 04:30:34,540
I've changed my game, you see, and simply because it was for my interest to change it.

2473
04:30:35,260 --> 04:30:44,100
Your interest is the same as mine; for it is only in England that you will ascertain whether you are in the service of a criminal or an honest man."

2474
04:30:44,980 --> 04:30:51,220
Passepartout listened very attentively to Fix, and was convinced that he spoke with entire good faith.

2475
04:30:52,039 --> 04:30:53,280
"Are we friends?"

2476
04:30:53,540 --> 04:30:54,340
asked the detective.

2477
04:30:55,180 --> 04:30:59,940
"Friends?--no," replied Passepartout; "but allies, perhaps.

2478
04:31:00,341 --> 04:31:04,020
At the least sign of treason, however, I'll twist your neck for you."

2479
04:31:05,140 --> 04:31:08,960
"Agreed," said the detective quietly.

2480
04:31:09,000 --> 04:31:16,840
Eleven days later, on the 3rd of December, the General Grant entered the bay of the Golden Gate, and reached San Francisco.

2481
04:31:17,881 --> 04:31:22,939
Mr. Fogg had neither gained nor lost a single day.

Around the World in Eighty Days

Jules Verne

2486
04:31:44,879 --> 04:31:48,450
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

2487
04:31:48,450 --> 04:31:50,850
Chapter 25

2488
04:31:50,850 --> 04:31:54,920
IN WHICH A SLIGHT GLIMPSE IS HAD OF SAN FRANCISCO

2489
04:31:55,579 --> 04:32:06,520
It was seven in the morning when Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout set foot upon the American continent, if this name can be given to the floating quay upon which they disembarked.

2490
04:32:07,580 --> 04:32:13,520
These quays, rising and falling with the tide, thus facilitate the loading and unloading of vessels.

2491
04:32:14,000 --> 04:32:25,680
Alongside them were clippers of all sizes, steamers of all nationalities, and the steamboats, with several decks rising one above the other, which ply on the Sacramento and its tributaries.

2492
04:32:26,520 --> 04:32:36,020
There were also heaped up the products of a commerce which extends to Mexico, Chili, Peru, Brazil, Europe, Asia, and all the Pacific islands.

2493
04:32:37,200 --> 04:32:50,860
Passepartout, in his joy on reaching at last the American continent, thought he would manifest it by executing a perilous vault in fine style; but, tumbling upon some worm-eaten planks, he fell through them.

2494
04:32:51,800 --> 04:33:05,740
Put out of countenance by the manner in which he thus "set foot" upon the New World, he uttered a loud cry, which so frightened the innumerable cormorants and pelicans that are always perched upon these movable quays, that they flew noisily away.

2495
04:33:06,879 --> 04:33:20,480
Mr. Fogg, on reaching shore, proceeded to find out at what hour the first train left for New York, and learned that this was at six o'clock p.m.; he had, therefore, an entire day to spend in the Californian capital.

2496
04:33:21,340 --> 04:33:31,541
Taking a carriage at a charge of three dollars, he and Aouda entered it, while Passepartout mounted the box beside the driver, and they set out for the International Hotel.

2497
04:33:33,040 --> 04:33:54,960
From his exalted position Passepartout observed with much curiosity the wide streets, the low, evenly ranged houses, the Anglo-Saxon Gothic churches, the great docks, the palatial wooden and brick warehouses, the numerous conveyances, omnibuses, horse-cars, and upon the side-walks, not only Americans and Europeans, but Chinese and Indians.

2498
04:33:55,740 --> 04:33:57,898
Passepartout was surprised at all he saw.

2499
04:33:58,599 --> 04:34:19,140
San Francisco was no longer the legendary city of 1849--a city of banditti, assassins, and incendiaries, who had flocked hither in crowds in pursuit of plunder; a paradise of outlaws, where they gambled with gold-dust, a revolver in one hand and a bowie-knife in the other: it was now a great commercial emporium.

2500
04:34:19,880 --> 04:34:37,860
The lofty tower of its City Hall overlooked the whole panorama of the streets and avenues, which cut each other at right-angles, and in the midst of which appeared pleasant, verdant squares, while beyond appeared the Chinese quarter, seemingly imported from the Celestial Empire in a toy-box.

2501
04:34:38,439 --> 04:34:50,980
Sombreros and red shirts and plumed Indians were rarely to be seen; but there were silk hats and black coats everywhere worn by a multitude of nervously active, gentlemanly-looking men.

2502
04:34:51,880 --> 04:35:10,541
Some of the streets--especially Montgomery Street, which is to San Francisco what Regent Street is to London, the Boulevard des Italiens to Paris, and Broadway to New York--were lined with splendid and spacious stores, which exposed in their windows the products of the entire world.

2503
04:35:11,840 --> 04:35:17,800
When Passepartout reached the International Hotel, it did not seem to him as if he had left England at all.

2504
04:35:18,458 --> 04:35:31,780
The ground floor of the hotel was occupied by a large bar, a sort of restaurant freely open to all passers-by, who might partake of dried beef, oyster soup, biscuits, and cheese, without taking out their purses.

2505
04:35:32,200 --> 04:35:36,580
Payment was made only for the ale, porter, or sherry which was drunk.

2506
04:35:37,400 --> 04:35:39,900
This seemed "very American" to Passepartout.

2507
04:35:40,419 --> 04:35:52,500
The hotel refreshment-rooms were comfortable, and Mr. Fogg and Aouda, installing themselves at a table, were abundantly served on diminutive plates by negroes of darkest hue.

2508
04:35:53,599 --> 04:36:00,320
After breakfast, Mr. Fogg, accompanied by Aouda, started for the English consulate to have his passport visaed.

2509
04:36:01,320 --> 04:36:11,599
As he was going out, he met Passepartout, who asked him if it would not be well, before taking the train, to purchase some dozens of Enfield rifles and Colt's revolvers.

2510
04:36:11,599 --> 04:36:17,259
He had been listening to stories of attacks upon the trains by the Sioux and Pawnees.

2511
04:36:17,939 --> 04:36:24,520
Mr. Fogg thought it a useless precaution, but told him to do as he thought best, and went on to the consulate.

2512
04:36:25,958 --> 04:36:32,220
He had not proceeded two hundred steps, however, when, "by the greatest chance in the world," he met Fix.

2513
04:36:32,779 --> 04:36:35,619
The detective seemed wholly taken by surprise.

2514
04:36:36,000 --> 04:36:36,480
What!

2515
04:36:36,639 --> 04:36:41,759
Had Mr. Fogg and himself crossed the Pacific together, and not met on the steamer!

2516
04:36:42,580 --> 04:36:54,320
At least Fix felt honoured to behold once more the gentleman to whom he owed so much, and, as his business recalled him to Europe, he should be delighted to continue the journey in such pleasant company.

2517
04:36:54,939 --> 04:37:08,540
Mr. Fogg replied that the honour would be his; and the detective--who was determined not to lose sight of him--begged permission to accompany them in their walk about San Francisco--a request which Mr. Fogg readily granted.

2518
04:37:09,621 --> 04:37:22,700
They soon found themselves in Montgomery Street, where a great crowd was collected; the side-walks, street, horsecar rails, the shop-doors, the windows of the houses, and even the roofs, were full of people.

2519
04:37:23,419 --> 04:37:31,880
Men were going about carrying large posters, and flags and streamers were floating in the wind; while loud cries were heard on every hand.

2520
04:37:32,259 --> 04:37:33,820
"Hurrah for Camerfield!"

2521
04:37:34,360 --> 04:37:35,980
"Hurrah for Mandiboy!"

2522
04:37:36,779 --> 04:37:44,779
It was a political meeting; at least so Fix conjectured, who said to Mr. Fogg, "Perhaps we had better not mingle with the crowd.

2523
04:37:45,180 --> 04:37:46,599
There may be danger in it."

2524
04:37:47,361 --> 04:37:53,660
"Yes," returned Mr. Fogg; "and blows, even if they are political are still blows."

2525
04:37:54,400 --> 04:38:07,121
Fix smiled at this remark; and, in order to be able to see without being jostled about, the party took up a position on the top of a flight of steps situated at the upper end of Montgomery Street.

2526
04:38:07,139 --> 04:38:19,259
Opposite them, on the other side of the street, between a coal wharf and a petroleum warehouse, a large platform had been erected in the open air, towards which the current of the crowd seemed to be directed.

2527
04:38:19,720 --> 04:38:21,240
For what purpose was this meeting?

2528
04:38:21,640 --> 04:38:24,560
What was the occasion of this excited assemblage?

2529
04:38:25,340 --> 04:38:27,259
Phileas Fogg could not imagine.

2530
04:38:28,000 --> 04:38:32,361
Was it to nominate some high official--a governor or member of Congress?

2531
04:38:32,960 --> 04:38:36,840
It was not improbable, so agitated was the multitude before them.

2532
04:38:37,380 --> 04:38:41,380
Just at this moment there was an unusual stir in the human mass.

2533
04:38:41,820 --> 04:38:43,900
All the hands were raised in the air.

2534
04:38:44,439 --> 04:38:52,640
Some, tightly closed, seemed to disappear suddenly in the midst of the cries--an energetic way, no doubt, of casting a vote.

2535
04:38:53,560 --> 04:39:00,560
The crowd swayed back, the banners and flags wavered, disappeared an instant, then reappeared in tatters.

2536
04:39:01,279 --> 04:39:09,840
The undulations of the human surge reached the steps, while all the heads floundered on the surface like a sea agitated by a squall.

2537
04:39:10,398 --> 04:39:16,240
Many of the black hats disappeared, and the greater part of the crowd seemed to have diminished in height.

2538
04:39:17,041 --> 04:39:22,779
"It is evidently a meeting," said Fix, "and its object must be an exciting one.

2539
04:39:22,800 --> 04:39:28,220
I should not wonder if it were about the Alabama, despite the fact that that question is settled."

2540
04:39:29,099 --> 04:39:31,619
"Perhaps," replied Mr. Fogg, simply.

2541
04:39:32,360 --> 04:39:40,780
"At least, there are two champions in presence of each other, the Honourable Mr. Camerfield and the Honourable Mr. Mandiboy."

2542
04:39:41,700 --> 04:39:50,760
Aouda, leaning upon Mr. Fogg's arm, observed the tumultuous scene with surprise, while Fix asked a man near him what the cause of it all was.

2543
04:39:51,160 --> 04:40:04,880
Before the man could reply, a fresh agitation arose; hurrahs and excited shouts were heard; the staffs of the banners began to be used as offensive weapons; and fists flew about in every direction.

2544
04:40:05,600 --> 04:40:11,560
Thumps were exchanged from the tops of the carriages and omnibuses which had been blocked up in the crowd.

2545
04:40:12,281 --> 04:40:23,660
Boots and shoes went whirling through the air, and Mr. Fogg thought he even heard the crack of revolvers mingling in the din, the rout approached the stairway, and flowed over the lower step.

2546
04:40:23,701 --> 04:40:32,740
One of the parties had evidently been repulsed; but the mere lookers-on could not tell whether Mandiboy or Camerfield had gained the upper hand.

2547
04:40:33,700 --> 04:40:42,559
"It would be prudent for us to retire," said Fix, who was anxious that Mr. Fogg should not receive any injury, at least until they got back to London.

2548
04:40:43,040 --> 04:40:49,400
"If there is any question about England in all this, and we were recognised, I fear it would go hard with us."

2549
04:40:50,200 --> 04:40:52,799
"An English subject--" began Mr. Fogg.

2550
04:40:53,120 --> 04:41:02,541
He did not finish his sentence; for a terrific hubbub now arose on the terrace behind the flight of steps where they stood, and there were frantic shouts of, "Hurrah for Mandiboy!

2551
04:41:02,660 --> 04:41:03,861
Hip, hip, hurrah!"

2552
04:41:04,380 --> 04:41:10,441
It was a band of voters coming to the rescue of their allies, and taking the Camerfield forces in flank.

2553
04:41:11,020 --> 04:41:16,780
Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix found themselves between two fires; it was too late to escape.

2554
04:41:17,219 --> 04:41:21,280
The torrent of men, armed with loaded canes and sticks, was irresistible.

2555
04:41:22,080 --> 04:41:36,318
Phileas Fogg and Fix were roughly hustled in their attempts to protect their fair companion; the former, as cool as ever, tried to defend himself with the weapons which nature has placed at the end of every Englishman's arm, but in vain.

2556
04:41:36,780 --> 04:41:51,920
A big brawny fellow with a red beard, flushed face, and broad shoulders, who seemed to be the chief of the band, raised his clenched fist to strike Mr. Fogg, whom he would have given a crushing blow, had not Fix rushed in and received it in his stead.

2557
04:41:52,700 --> 04:41:59,660
An enormous bruise immediately made its appearance under the detective's silk hat, which was completely smashed in.

2558
04:42:00,441 --> 04:42:01,480
"Yankee!"

2559
04:42:01,500 --> 04:42:05,139
exclaimed Mr. Fogg, darting a contemptuous look at the ruffian.

2560
04:42:05,640 --> 04:42:06,480
"Englishman!"

2561
04:42:06,879 --> 04:42:07,682
returned the other.

2562
04:42:07,920 --> 04:42:09,220
"We will meet again!"

2563
04:42:09,840 --> 04:42:10,879
"When you please."

2564
04:42:11,400 --> 04:42:12,300
"What is your name?"

2565
04:42:13,080 --> 04:42:13,880
"Phileas Fogg.

2566
04:42:14,160 --> 04:42:14,780
And yours?"

2567
04:42:15,400 --> 04:42:17,000
"Colonel Stamp Proctor."

2568
04:42:17,900 --> 04:42:25,840
The human tide now swept by, after overturning Fix, who speedily got upon his feet again, though with tattered clothes.

2569
04:42:26,420 --> 04:42:28,320
Happily, he was not seriously hurt.

2570
04:42:28,920 --> 04:42:39,941
His travelling overcoat was divided into two unequal parts, and his trousers resembled those of certain Indians, which fit less compactly than they are easy to put on.

2571
04:42:40,620 --> 04:42:47,060
Aouda had escaped unharmed, and Fix alone bore marks of the fray in his black and blue bruise.

2572
04:42:47,680 --> 04:42:51,840
"Thanks," said Mr. Fogg to the detective, as soon as they were out of the crowd.

2573
04:42:52,560 --> 04:42:54,560
"No thanks are necessary," replied.

2574
04:42:54,680 --> 04:42:56,160
Fix; "but let us go."

2575
04:42:56,861 --> 04:42:57,220
"Where?"

2576
04:42:57,740 --> 04:42:58,660
"To a tailor's."

2577
04:42:59,459 --> 04:43:01,639
Such a visit was, indeed, opportune.

2578
04:43:02,220 --> 04:43:12,139
The clothing of both Mr. Fogg and Fix was in rags, as if they had themselves been actively engaged in the contest between Camerfield and Mandiboy.

2579
04:43:13,260 --> 04:43:19,960
An hour after, they were once more suitably attired, and with Aouda returned to the International Hotel.

2580
04:43:20,920 --> 04:43:26,280
Passepartout was waiting for his master, armed with half a dozen six-barrelled revolvers.

2581
04:43:26,700 --> 04:43:36,280
When he perceived Fix, he knit his brows; but Aouda having, in a few words, told him of their adventure, his countenance resumed its placid expression.

2582
04:43:37,160 --> 04:43:43,020
Fix evidently was no longer an enemy, but an ally; he was faithfully keeping his word.

2583
04:43:44,280 --> 04:43:50,780
Dinner over, the coach which was to convey the passengers and their luggage to the station drew up to the door.

2584
04:43:51,800 --> 04:43:57,340
As he was getting in, Mr. Fogg said to Fix, "You have not seen this Colonel Proctor again?"

2585
04:43:57,941 --> 04:43:58,201
"No."

2586
04:43:59,020 --> 04:44:02,719
"I will come back to America to find him," said Phileas Fogg calmly.

2587
04:44:03,300 --> 04:44:10,500
"It would not be right for an Englishman to permit himself to be treated in that way, without retaliating."

2588
04:44:10,560 --> 04:44:12,900
The detective smiled, but did not reply.

2589
04:44:13,560 --> 04:44:22,480
It was clear that Mr. Fogg was one of those Englishmen who, while they do not tolerate duelling at home, fight abroad when their honour is attacked.

2590
04:44:23,860 --> 04:44:30,100
At a quarter before six the travellers reached the station, and found the train ready to depart.

2591
04:44:30,121 --> 04:44:38,300
As he was about to enter it, Mr. Fogg called a porter, and said to him: "My friend, was there not some trouble to-day in San Francisco?"

2592
04:44:39,060 --> 04:44:42,040
"It was a political meeting, sir," replied the porter.

2593
04:44:42,940 --> 04:44:46,420
"But I thought there was a great deal of disturbance in the streets."

2594
04:44:47,139 --> 04:44:50,020
"It was only a meeting assembled for an election."

2595
04:44:50,700 --> 04:44:53,400
"The election of a general-in-chief, no doubt?"

2596
04:44:53,680 --> 04:44:54,560
asked Mr. Fogg.

2597
04:44:55,299 --> 04:44:57,720
"No, sir; of a justice of the peace."

2598
04:44:58,880 --> 04:45:02,760
Phileas Fogg got into the train, which started off at full speed.

2599

Around the World in Eighty Days

Translated by George Makepeace Towle

Chapter 26

2605
04:45:29,340 --> 04:45:34,260
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AND PARTY TRAVEL BY THE PACIFIC RAILROAD

2606
04:45:34,900 --> 04:45:46,440
"From ocean to ocean"--so say the Americans; and these four words compose the general designation of the "great trunk line" which crosses the entire width of the United States.

2607
04:45:47,120 --> 04:45:59,340
The Pacific Railroad is, however, really divided into two distinct lines: the Central Pacific, between San Francisco and Ogden, and the Union Pacific, between Ogden and Omaha.

2608
04:46:00,080 --> 04:46:02,920
Five main lines connect Omaha with New York.

2609
04:46:03,640 --> 04:46:13,920
New York and San Francisco are thus united by an uninterrupted metal ribbon, which measures no less than three thousand seven hundred and eighty-six miles.

2610
04:46:14,441 --> 04:46:29,160
Between Omaha and the Pacific the railway crosses a territory which is still infested by Indians and wild beasts, and a large tract which the Mormons, after they were driven from Illinois in 1845, began to colonise.

2611
04:46:29,740 --> 04:46:37,720
The journey from New York to San Francisco consumed, formerly, under the most favourable conditions, at least six months.

2612
04:46:37,740 --> 04:46:40,320
It is now accomplished in seven days.

2613
04:46:40,861 --> 04:46:52,140
It was in 1862 that, in spite of the Southern Members of Congress, who wished a more southerly route, it was decided to lay the road between the forty-first and forty-second parallels.

2614
04:46:52,541 --> 04:46:57,180
President Lincoln himself fixed the end of the line at Omaha, in Nebraska.

2615
04:46:57,840 --> 04:47:07,840
The work was at once commenced, and pursued with true American energy; nor did the rapidity with which it went on injuriously affect its good execution.

2616
04:47:08,580 --> 04:47:11,660
The road grew, on the prairies, a mile and a half a day.

2617
04:47:12,180 --> 04:47:22,040
A locomotive, running on the rails laid down the evening before, brought the rails to be laid on the morrow, and advanced upon them as fast as they were put in position.

2618
04:47:22,820 --> 04:47:28,640
The Pacific Railroad is joined by several branches in Iowa, Kansas, Colorado, and Oregon.

2619
04:47:29,340 --> 04:48:03,260
On leaving Omaha, it passes along the left bank of the Platte River as far as the junction of its northern branch, follows its southern branch, crosses the Laramie territory and the Wahsatch Mountains, turns the Great Salt Lake, and reaches Salt Lake City, the Mormon capital, plunges into the Tuilla Valley, across the American Desert, Cedar and Humboldt Mountains, the Sierra Nevada, and descends, via Sacramento, to the Pacific--its grade, even on the Rocky Mountains, never exceeding one hundred and twelve feet to the mile.

2620
04:48:04,260 --> 04:48:14,820
Such was the road to be traversed in seven days, which would enable Phileas Fogg--at least, so he hoped--to take the Atlantic steamer at New York on the 11th for Liverpool.

2621
04:48:15,799 --> 04:48:22,639
The car which he occupied was a sort of long omnibus on eight wheels, and with no compartments in the interior.

2622
04:48:23,320 --> 04:48:32,840
It was supplied with two rows of seats, perpendicular to the direction of the train on either side of an aisle which conducted to the front and rear platforms.

2623
04:48:33,320 --> 04:48:40,020
These platforms were found throughout the train, and the passengers were able to pass from one end of the train to the other.

2624
04:48:40,559 --> 04:48:50,640
It was supplied with saloon cars, balcony cars, restaurants, and smoking-cars; theatre cars alone were wanting, and they will have these some day.

2625
04:48:51,680 --> 04:49:00,780
Book and news dealers, sellers of edibles, drinkables, and cigars, who seemed to have plenty of customers, were continually circulating in the aisles.

2626
04:49:01,959 --> 04:49:04,780
The train left Oakland station at six o'clock.

2627
04:49:05,140 --> 04:49:11,818
It was already night, cold and cheerless, the heavens being overcast with clouds which seemed to threaten snow.

2628
04:49:12,660 --> 04:49:24,560
The train did not proceed rapidly; counting the stoppages, it did not run more than twenty miles an hour, which was a sufficient speed, however, to enable it to reach Omaha within its designated time.

2629
04:49:25,500 --> 04:49:31,380
There was but little conversation in the car, and soon many of the passengers were overcome with sleep.

2630
04:49:32,180 --> 04:49:37,059
Passepartout found himself beside the detective; but he did not talk to him.

2631
04:49:37,080 --> 04:49:45,420
After recent events, their relations with each other had grown somewhat cold; there could no longer be mutual sympathy or intimacy between them.

2632
04:49:45,980 --> 04:49:54,041
Fix's manner had not changed; but Passepartout was very reserved, and ready to strangle his former friend on the slightest provocation.

2633
04:49:55,020 --> 04:50:10,121
Snow began to fall an hour after they started, a fine snow, however, which happily could not obstruct the train; nothing could be seen from the windows but a vast, white sheet, against which the smoke of the locomotive had a greyish aspect.

2634
04:50:11,260 --> 04:50:21,160
At eight o'clock a steward entered the car and announced that the time for going to bed had arrived; and in a few minutes the car was transformed into a dormitory.

2635
04:50:21,720 --> 04:50:39,160
The backs of the seats were thrown back, bedsteads carefully packed were rolled out by an ingenious system, berths were suddenly improvised, and each traveller had soon at his disposition a comfortable bed, protected from curious eyes by thick curtains.

2636
04:50:39,640 --> 04:50:42,041
The sheets were clean and the pillows soft.

2637
04:50:42,560 --> 04:50:49,920
It only remained to go to bed and sleep which everybody did--while the train sped on across the State of California.

2638
04:50:51,219 --> 04:50:55,460
The country between San Francisco and Sacramento is not very hilly.

2639
04:50:56,041 --> 04:51:03,080
The Central Pacific, taking Sacramento for its starting-point, extends eastward to meet the road from Omaha.

2640
04:51:03,840 --> 04:51:13,059
The line from San Francisco to Sacramento runs in a north-easterly direction, along the American River, which empties into San Pablo Bay.

2641
04:51:13,861 --> 04:51:33,360
The one hundred and twenty miles between these cities were accomplished in six hours, and towards midnight, while fast asleep, the travellers passed through Sacramento; so that they saw nothing of that important place, the seat of the State government, with its fine quays, its broad streets, its noble hotels, squares, and churches.

2642
04:51:34,220 --> 04:51:42,040
The train, on leaving Sacramento, and passing the junction, Roclin, Auburn, and Colfax, entered the range of the Sierra Nevada.

2643
04:51:42,600 --> 04:51:55,640
'Cisco was reached at seven in the morning; and an hour later the dormitory was transformed into an ordinary car, and the travellers could observe the picturesque beauties of the mountain region through which they were steaming.

2644
04:51:56,340 --> 04:52:11,020
The railway track wound in and out among the passes, now approaching the mountain-sides, now suspended over precipices, avoiding abrupt angles by bold curves, plunging into narrow defiles, which seemed to have no outlet.

2645
04:52:11,660 --> 04:52:28,140
The locomotive, its great funnel emitting a weird light, with its sharp bell, and its cow-catcher extended like a spur, mingled its shrieks and bellowings with the noise of torrents and cascades, and twined its smoke among the branches of the gigantic pines.

2646
04:52:28,720 --> 04:52:31,780
There were few or no bridges or tunnels on the route.

2647
04:52:32,380 --> 04:52:40,660
The railway turned around the sides of the mountains, and did not attempt to violate nature by taking the shortest cut from one point to another.

2648
04:52:41,660 --> 04:52:52,980
The train entered the State of Nevada through the Carson Valley about nine o'clock, going always northeasterly; and at midday reached Reno, where there was a delay of twenty minutes for breakfast.

2649
04:52:53,898 --> 04:53:07,540
From this point the road, running along Humboldt River, passed northward for several miles by its banks; then it turned eastward, and kept by the river until it reached the Humboldt Range, nearly at the extreme eastern limit of Nevada.

2650
04:53:08,940 --> 04:53:25,340
Having breakfasted, Mr. Fogg and his companions resumed their places in the car, and observed the varied landscape which unfolded itself as they passed along the vast prairies, the mountains lining the horizon, and the creeks, with their frothy, foaming streams.

2651
04:53:25,639 --> 04:53:32,240
Sometimes a great herd of buffaloes, massing together in the distance, seemed like a moveable dam.

2652
04:53:32,840 --> 04:53:46,500
These innumerable multitudes of ruminating beasts often form an insurmountable obstacle to the passage of the trains; thousands of them have been seen passing over the track for hours together, in compact ranks.

2653
04:53:46,900 --> 04:53:52,020
The locomotive is then forced to stop and wait till the road is once more clear.

2654
04:53:52,660 --> 04:53:56,660
This happened, indeed, to the train in which Mr. Fogg was travelling.

2655
04:53:57,260 --> 04:54:02,299
About twelve o'clock a troop of ten or twelve thousand head of buffalo encumbered the track.

2656
04:54:02,680 --> 04:54:09,820
The locomotive, slackening its speed, tried to clear the way with its cow-catcher; but the mass of animals was too great.

2657
04:54:10,320 --> 04:54:16,000
The buffaloes marched along with a tranquil gait, uttering now and then deafening bellowings.

2658
04:54:16,320 --> 04:54:28,560
There was no use of interrupting them, for, having taken a particular direction, nothing can moderate and change their course; it is a torrent of living flesh which no dam could contain.

2659
04:54:29,360 --> 04:54:43,280
The travellers gazed on this curious spectacle from the platforms; but Phileas Fogg, who had the most reason of all to be in a hurry, remained in his seat, and waited philosophically until it should please the buffaloes to get out of the way.

2660
04:54:43,860 --> 04:54:50,160
Passepartout was furious at the delay they occasioned, and longed to discharge his arsenal of revolvers upon them.

2661
04:54:50,680 --> 04:54:51,541
"What a country!"

2662
04:54:51,820 --> 04:54:52,260
cried he.

2663
04:54:52,520 --> 04:54:57,940
"Mere cattle stop the trains, and go by in a procession, just as if they were not impeding travel!

2664
04:54:58,360 --> 04:54:59,060
Parbleu!

2665
04:54:59,600 --> 04:55:04,240
I should like to know if Mr. Fogg foresaw this mishap in his programme!

2666
04:55:04,260 --> 04:55:09,000
And here's an engineer who doesn't dare to run the locomotive into this herd of beasts!"

2667
04:55:10,040 --> 04:55:14,140
The engineer did not try to overcome the obstacle, and he was wise.

2668
04:55:14,520 --> 04:55:27,400
He would have crushed the first buffaloes, no doubt, with the cow-catcher; but the locomotive, however powerful, would soon have been checked, the train would inevitably have been thrown off the track, and would then have been helpless.

2669
04:55:27,900 --> 04:55:34,520
The best course was to wait patiently, and regain the lost time by greater speed when the obstacle was removed.

2670
04:55:35,200 --> 04:55:41,240
The procession of buffaloes lasted three full hours, and it was night before the track was clear.

2671
04:55:41,320 --> 04:55:48,980
The last ranks of the herd were now passing over the rails, while the first had already disappeared below the southern horizon.

2672
04:55:49,960 --> 04:56:03,560
It was eight o'clock when the train passed through the defiles of the Humboldt Range, and half-past nine when it penetrated Utah, the region of the Great Salt Lake, the singular colony of the Mormons.

2673

2679
04:56:29,390 --> 04:56:36,570
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT UNDERGOES, AT A SPEED OF TWENTY MILES AN HOUR, A COURSE OF MORMON HISTORY

2680
04:56:37,240 --> 04:56:48,139
During the night of the 5th of December, the train ran south-easterly for about fifty miles; then rose an equal distance in a north-easterly direction, towards the Great Salt Lake.

2681
04:56:49,080 --> 04:56:53,020
Passepartout, about nine o'clock, went out upon the platform to take the air.

2682
04:56:53,860 --> 04:56:57,840
The weather was cold, the heavens grey, but it was not snowing.

2683
04:56:58,700 --> 04:57:15,080
The sun's disc, enlarged by the mist, seemed an enormous ring of gold, and Passepartout was amusing himself by calculating its value in pounds sterling, when he was diverted from this interesting study by a strange-looking personage who made his appearance on the platform.

2684
04:57:15,621 --> 04:57:28,980
This personage, who had taken the train at Elko, was tall and dark, with black moustache, black stockings, a black silk hat, a black waistcoat, black trousers, a white cravat, and dogskin gloves.

2685
04:57:29,740 --> 04:57:31,560
He might have been taken for a clergyman.

2686
04:57:32,160 --> 04:57:38,960
He went from one end of the train to the other, and affixed to the door of each car a notice written in manuscript.

2687
04:57:39,340 --> 04:58:03,959
Passepartout approached and read one of these notices, which stated that Elder William Hitch, Mormon missionary, taking advantage of his presence on train No. 48, would deliver a lecture on Mormonism in car No. 117, from eleven to twelve o'clock; and that he invited all who were desirous of being instructed concerning the mysteries of the religion of the "Latter Day Saints" to attend.

2688
04:58:04,820 --> 04:58:07,560
"I'll go," said Passepartout to himself.

2689
04:58:07,879 --> 04:58:12,620
He knew nothing of Mormonism except the custom of polygamy, which is its foundation.

2690
04:58:13,860 --> 04:58:23,360
The news quickly spread through the train, which contained about one hundred passengers, thirty of whom, at most, attracted by the notice, ensconced themselves in car No.

2691
04:58:23,380 --> 04:58:24,360
117.

2692
04:58:25,020 --> 04:58:27,280
Passepartout took one of the front seats.

2693
04:58:27,760 --> 04:58:30,441
Neither Mr. Fogg nor Fix cared to attend.

2694
04:58:31,420 --> 04:58:50,420
At the appointed hour Elder William Hitch rose, and, in an irritated voice, as if he had already been contradicted, said, "I tell you that Joe Smith is a martyr, that his brother Hiram is a martyr, and that the persecutions of the United States Government against the prophets will also make a martyr of Brigham Young.

2695
04:58:50,520 --> 04:58:51,980
Who dares to say the contrary?"

2696
04:58:52,820 --> 04:59:00,020
No one ventured to gainsay the missionary, whose excited tone contrasted curiously with his naturally calm visage.

2697
04:59:00,540 --> 04:59:05,420
No doubt his anger arose from the hardships to which the Mormons were actually subjected.

2698
04:59:06,040 --> 04:59:12,660
The government had just succeeded, with some difficulty, in reducing these independent fanatics to its rule.

2699
04:59:12,700 --> 04:59:22,361
It had made itself master of Utah, and subjected that territory to the laws of the Union, after imprisoning Brigham Young on a charge of rebellion and polygamy.

2700
04:59:23,102 --> 04:59:29,820
The disciples of the prophet had since redoubled their efforts, and resisted, by words at least, the authority of Congress.

2701
04:59:30,500 --> 04:59:35,459
Elder Hitch, as is seen, was trying to make proselytes on the very railway trains.

2702
04:59:36,100 --> 05:00:13,040
Then, emphasising his words with his loud voice and frequent gestures, he related the history of the Mormons from Biblical times: how that, in Israel, a Mormon prophet of the tribe of Joseph published the annals of the new religion, and bequeathed them to his son Mormon; how, many centuries later, a translation of this precious book, which was written in Egyptian, was made by Joseph Smith, junior, a Vermont farmer, who revealed himself as a mystical prophet in 1825; and how, in short, the celestial messenger appeared to him in an illuminated forest, and gave him the annals of the Lord.

2703
05:00:13,780 --> 05:00:59,060
Several of the audience, not being much interested in the missionary's narrative, here left the car; but Elder Hitch, continuing his lecture, related how Smith, junior, with his father, two brothers, and a few disciples, founded the church of the "Latter Day Saints," which, adopted not only in America, but in England, Norway and Sweden, and Germany, counts many artisans, as well as men engaged in the liberal professions, among its members; how a colony was established in Ohio, a temple erected there at a cost of two hundred thousand dollars, and a town built at Kirkland; how Smith became an enterprising banker, and received from a simple mummy showman a papyrus scroll written by Abraham and several famous Egyptians.

2704
05:01:00,281 --> 05:01:07,580
The Elder's story became somewhat wearisome, and his audience grew gradually less, until it was reduced to twenty passengers.

2705
05:01:07,880 --> 05:01:34,340
But this did not disconcert the enthusiast, who proceeded with the story of Joseph Smith's bankruptcy in 1837, and how his ruined creditors gave him a coat of tar and feathers; his reappearance some years afterwards, more honourable and honoured than ever, at Independence, Missouri, the chief of a flourishing colony of three thousand disciples, and his pursuit thence by outraged Gentiles, and retirement into the Far West.

2706
05:01:34,959 --> 05:01:40,820
Ten hearers only were now left, among them honest Passepartout, who was listening with all his ears.

2707
05:01:41,360 --> 05:02:15,140
Thus he learned that, after long persecutions, Smith reappeared in Illinois, and in 1839 founded a community at Nauvoo, on the Mississippi, numbering twenty-five thousand souls, of which he became mayor, chief justice, and general-in-chief; that he announced himself, in 1843, as a candidate for the Presidency of the United States; and that finally, being drawn into ambuscade at Carthage, he was thrown into prison, and assassinated by a band of men disguised in masks.

2708
05:02:16,000 --> 05:02:44,760
Passepartout was now the only person left in the car, and the Elder, looking him full in the face, reminded him that, two years after the assassination of Joseph Smith, the inspired prophet, Brigham Young, his successor, left Nauvoo for the banks of the Great Salt Lake, where, in the midst of that fertile region, directly on the route of the emigrants who crossed Utah on their way to California, the new colony, thanks to the polygamy practised by the Mormons, had flourished beyond expectations.

2709
05:02:45,360 --> 05:02:51,420
"And this," added Elder William Hitch, "this is why the jealousy of Congress has been aroused against us!

2710
05:02:51,840 --> 05:02:55,160
Why have the soldiers of the Union invaded the soil of Utah?

2711
05:02:55,460 --> 05:02:59,840
Why has Brigham Young, our chief, been imprisoned, in contempt of all justice?

2712
05:03:00,220 --> 05:03:01,860
Shall we yield to force?

2713
05:03:02,100 --> 05:03:02,520
Never!

2714
05:03:02,940 --> 05:03:14,220
Driven from Vermont, driven from Illinois, driven from Ohio, driven from Missouri, driven from Utah, we shall yet find some independent territory on which to plant our tents.

2715
05:03:14,240 --> 05:03:23,240
And you, my brother," continued the Elder, fixing his angry eyes upon his single auditor, "will you not plant yours there, too, under the shadow of our flag?"

2716
05:03:23,740 --> 05:03:24,120
"No!"

2717
05:03:24,460 --> 05:03:30,660
replied Passepartout courageously, in his turn retiring from the car, and leaving the Elder to preach to vacancy.

2718
05:03:32,080 --> 05:03:39,700
During the lecture the train had been making good progress, and towards half-past twelve it reached the northwest border of the Great Salt Lake.

2719
05:03:40,380 --> 05:03:49,660
Thence the passengers could observe the vast extent of this interior sea, which is also called the Dead Sea, and into which flows an American Jordan.

2720
05:03:50,540 --> 05:04:09,361
It is a picturesque expanse, framed in lofty crags in large strata, encrusted with white salt--a superb sheet of water, which was formerly of larger extent than now, its shores having encroached with the lapse of time, and thus at once reduced its breadth and increased its depth.

2721
05:04:10,180 --> 05:04:17,540
The Salt Lake, seventy miles long and thirty-five wide, is situated three miles eight hundred feet above the sea.

2722
05:04:18,140 --> 05:04:35,580
Quite different from Lake Asphaltite, whose depression is twelve hundred feet below the sea, it contains considerable salt, and one quarter of the weight of its water is solid matter, its specific weight being 1,170, and, after being distilled, 1,000.

2723
05:04:36,420 --> 05:04:44,340
Fishes are, of course, unable to live in it, and those which descend through the Jordan, the Weber, and other streams soon perish.

2724
05:04:45,120 --> 05:05:04,540
The country around the lake was well cultivated, for the Mormons are mostly farmers; while ranches and pens for domesticated animals, fields of wheat, corn, and other cereals, luxuriant prairies, hedges of wild rose, clumps of acacias and milk-wort, would have been seen six months later.

2725
05:05:05,160 --> 05:05:08,521
Now the ground was covered with a thin powdering of snow.

2726
05:05:09,240 --> 05:05:32,660
The train reached Ogden at two o'clock, where it rested for six hours, Mr. Fogg and his party had time to pay a visit to Salt Lake City, connected with Ogden by a branch road; and they spent two hours in this strikingly American town, built on the pattern of other cities of the Union, like a checker-board, "with the sombre sadness of right-angles," as Victor Hugo expresses it.

2727
05:05:33,340 --> 05:05:40,320
The founder of the City of the Saints could not escape from the taste for symmetry which distinguishes the Anglo-Saxons.

2728
05:05:40,960 --> 05:05:50,340
In this strange country, where the people are certainly not up to the level of their institutions, everything is done "squarely"--cities, houses, and follies.

2729
05:05:51,300 --> 05:05:59,940
The travellers, then, were promenading, at three o'clock, about the streets of the town built between the banks of the Jordan and the spurs of the Wahsatch Range.

2730
05:06:00,541 --> 05:06:13,540
They saw few or no churches, but the prophet's mansion, the court-house, and the arsenal, blue-brick houses with verandas and porches, surrounded by gardens bordered with acacias, palms, and locusts.

2731
05:06:14,320 --> 05:06:24,380
A clay and pebble wall, built in 1853, surrounded the town; and in the principal street were the market and several hotels adorned with pavilions.

2732
05:06:25,140 --> 05:06:27,640
The place did not seem thickly populated.

2733
05:06:28,160 --> 05:06:37,720
The streets were almost deserted, except in the vicinity of the temple, which they only reached after having traversed several quarters surrounded by palisades.

2734
05:06:38,121 --> 05:06:47,280
There were many women, which was easily accounted for by the "peculiar institution" of the Mormons; but it must not be supposed that all the Mormons are polygamists.

2735
05:06:47,680 --> 05:07:02,500
They are free to marry or not, as they please; but it is worth noting that it is mainly the female citizens of Utah who are anxious to marry, as, according to the Mormon religion, maiden ladies are not admitted to the possession of its highest joys.

2736
05:07:03,120 --> 05:07:06,320
These poor creatures seemed to be neither well off nor happy.

2737
05:07:06,700 --> 05:07:16,940
Some--the more well-to-do, no doubt--wore short, open, black silk dresses, under a hood or modest shawl; others were habited in Indian fashion.

2738
05:07:17,480 --> 05:07:24,780
Passepartout could not behold without a certain fright these women, charged, in groups, with conferring happiness on a single Mormon.

2739
05:07:25,360 --> 05:07:27,879
His common sense pitied, above all, the husband.

2740
05:07:28,460 --> 05:07:48,440
It seemed to him a terrible thing to have to guide so many wives at once across the vicissitudes of life, and to conduct them, as it were, in a body to the Mormon paradise with the prospect of seeing them in the company of the glorious Smith, who doubtless was the chief ornament of that delightful place, to all eternity.

2741
05:07:48,440 --> 05:07:57,980
He felt decidedly repelled from such a vocation, and he imagined--perhaps he was mistaken--that the fair ones of Salt Lake City cast rather alarming glances on his person.

2742
05:07:58,860 --> 05:08:01,000
Happily, his stay there was but brief.

2743
05:08:01,560 --> 05:08:08,480
At four the party found themselves again at the station, took their places in the train, and the whistle sounded for starting.

2744
05:08:09,340 --> 05:08:14,360
Just at the moment, however, that the locomotive wheels began to move, cries of "Stop!

2745
05:08:14,440 --> 05:08:14,900
stop!"

2746
05:08:15,240 --> 05:08:15,720
were heard.

2747
05:08:16,280 --> 05:08:19,280
Trains, like time and tide, stop for no one.

2748
05:08:19,900 --> 05:08:23,480
The gentleman who uttered the cries was evidently a belated Mormon.

2749
05:08:23,800 --> 05:08:25,280
He was breathless with running.

2750
05:08:26,000 --> 05:08:29,320
Happily for him, the station had neither gates nor barriers.

2751
05:08:29,820 --> 05:08:36,360
He rushed along the track, jumped on the rear platform of the train, and fell, exhausted, into one of the seats.

2752
05:08:36,940 --> 05:08:46,760
Passepartout, who had been anxiously watching this amateur gymnast, approached him with lively interest, and learned that he had taken flight after an unpleasant domestic scene.

2753
05:08:47,500 --> 05:08:58,820
When the Mormon had recovered his breath, Passepartout ventured to ask him politely how many wives he had; for, from the manner in which he had decamped, it might be thought that he had twenty at least.

2754
05:08:59,380 --> 05:09:04,700
"One, sir," replied the Mormon, raising his arms heavenward--"one, and that was enough!"

2755
05:09:05,512 --> 05:09:08,940

Chapter 28

2761
05:09:31,850 --> 05:09:37,590
IN WHICH PASSEPARTOUT DOES NOT SUCCEED IN MAKING ANYBODY LISTEN TO REASON

2762
05:09:38,380 --> 05:09:48,620
The train, on leaving Great Salt Lake at Ogden, passed northward for an hour as far as Weber River, having completed nearly nine hundred miles from San Francisco.

2763
05:09:49,480 --> 05:09:54,740
From this point it took an easterly direction towards the jagged Wahsatch Mountains.

2764
05:09:54,760 --> 05:10:13,580
It was in the section included between this range and the Rocky Mountains that the American engineers found the most formidable difficulties in laying the road, and that the government granted a subsidy of forty-eight thousand dollars per mile, instead of sixteen thousand allowed for the work done on the plains.

2765
05:10:14,480 --> 05:10:22,580
But the engineers, instead of violating nature, avoided its difficulties by winding around, instead of penetrating the rocks.

2766
05:10:23,180 --> 05:10:29,621
One tunnel only, fourteen thousand feet in length, was pierced in order to arrive at the great basin.

2767
05:10:30,340 --> 05:10:34,680
The track up to this time had reached its highest elevation at the Great Salt Lake.

2768
05:10:35,361 --> 05:10:45,240
From this point it described a long curve, descending towards Bitter Creek Valley, to rise again to the dividing ridge of the waters between the Atlantic and the Pacific.

2769
05:10:45,920 --> 05:10:53,820
There were many creeks in this mountainous region, and it was necessary to cross Muddy Creek, Green Creek, and others, upon culverts.

2770
05:10:54,660 --> 05:11:10,320
Passepartout grew more and more impatient as they went on, while Fix longed to get out of this difficult region, and was more anxious than Phileas Fogg himself to be beyond the danger of delays and accidents, and set foot on English soil.

2771
05:11:11,260 --> 05:11:21,420
At ten o'clock at night the train stopped at Fort Bridger station, and twenty minutes later entered Wyoming Territory, following the valley of Bitter Creek throughout.

2772
05:11:22,379 --> 05:11:27,900
The next day, 7th December, they stopped for a quarter of an hour at Green River station.

2773
05:11:28,318 --> 05:11:36,160
Snow had fallen abundantly during the night, but, being mixed with rain, it had half melted, and did not interrupt their progress.

2774
05:11:36,840 --> 05:11:46,020
The bad weather, however, annoyed Passepartout; for the accumulation of snow, by blocking the wheels of the cars, would certainly have been fatal to Mr. Fogg's tour.

2775
05:11:46,602 --> 05:11:48,480
"What an idea!"

2776
05:11:48,500 --> 05:11:49,320
he said to himself.

2777
05:11:49,580 --> 05:11:52,160
"Why did my master make this journey in winter?

2778
05:11:52,639 --> 05:11:56,180
Couldn't he have waited for the good season to increase his chances?"

2779
05:11:56,760 --> 05:12:06,580
While the worthy Frenchman was absorbed in the state of the sky and the depression of the temperature, Aouda was experiencing fears from a totally different cause.

2780
05:12:07,040 --> 05:12:20,660
Several passengers had got off at Green River, and were walking up and down the platforms; and among these Aouda recognised Colonel Stamp Proctor, the same who had so grossly insulted Phileas Fogg at the San Francisco meeting.

2781
05:12:21,379 --> 05:12:27,800
Not wishing to be recognised, the young woman drew back from the window, feeling much alarm at her discovery.

2782
05:12:28,340 --> 05:12:34,260
She was attached to the man who, however coldly, gave her daily evidences of the most absolute devotion.

2783
05:12:34,799 --> 05:12:46,139
She did not comprehend, perhaps, the depth of the sentiment with which her protector inspired her, which she called gratitude, but which, though she was unconscious of it, was really more than that.

2784
05:12:46,980 --> 05:12:54,880
Her heart sank within her when she recognised the man whom Mr. Fogg desired, sooner or later, to call to account for his conduct.

2785
05:12:55,580 --> 05:13:06,180
Chance alone, it was clear, had brought Colonel Proctor on this train; but there he was, and it was necessary, at all hazards, that Phileas Fogg should not perceive his adversary.

2786
05:13:06,879 --> 05:13:12,820
Aouda seized a moment when Mr. Fogg was asleep to tell Fix and Passepartout whom she had seen.

2787
05:13:13,340 --> 05:13:15,281
"That Proctor on this train!"

2788
05:13:15,460 --> 05:13:16,219
cried Fix.

2789
05:13:16,400 --> 05:13:22,459
"Well, reassure yourself, madam; before he settles with Mr. Fogg; he has got to deal with me!

2790
05:13:23,060 --> 05:13:26,200
It seems to me that I was the more insulted of the two."

2791
05:13:26,720 --> 05:13:31,940
"And, besides," added Passepartout, "I'll take charge of him, colonel as he is."

2792
05:13:32,580 --> 05:13:37,459
"Mr. Fix," resumed Aouda, "Mr. Fogg will allow no one to avenge him.

2793
05:13:37,960 --> 05:13:40,898
He said that he would come back to America to find this man.

2794
05:13:41,459 --> 05:13:47,720
Should he perceive Colonel Proctor, we could not prevent a collision which might have terrible results.

2795
05:13:47,740 --> 05:13:49,021
He must not see him."

2796
05:13:49,680 --> 05:13:54,719
"You are right, madam," replied Fix; "a meeting between them might ruin all.

2797
05:13:55,320 --> 05:13:59,459
Whether he were victorious or beaten, Mr. Fogg would be delayed, and--"

2798
05:13:59,880 --> 05:14:04,700
"And," added Passepartout, "that would play the game of the gentlemen of the Reform Club.

2799
05:14:05,300 --> 05:14:07,160
In four days we shall be in New York.

2800
05:14:07,682 --> 05:14:16,441
Well, if my master does not leave this car during those four days, we may hope that chance will not bring him face to face with this confounded American.

2801
05:14:16,660 --> 05:14:19,600
We must, if possible, prevent his stirring out of it."

2802
05:14:20,060 --> 05:14:21,520
The conversation dropped.

2803
05:14:21,879 --> 05:14:25,420
Mr. Fogg had just woke up, and was looking out of the window.

2804
05:14:26,100 --> 05:14:34,080
Soon after Passepartout, without being heard by his master or Aouda, whispered to the detective, "Would you really fight for him?"

2805
05:14:34,959 --> 05:14:42,000
"I would do anything," replied Fix, in a tone which betrayed determined will, "to get him back living to Europe!"

2806
05:14:42,740 --> 05:14:49,000
Passepartout felt something like a shudder shoot through his frame, but his confidence in his master remained unbroken.

2807
05:14:49,820 --> 05:14:55,400
Was there any means of detaining Mr. Fogg in the car, to avoid a meeting between him and the colonel?

2808
05:14:56,080 --> 05:15:02,360
It ought not to be a difficult task, since that gentleman was naturally sedentary and little curious.

2809
05:15:03,299 --> 05:15:12,900
The detective, at least, seemed to have found a way; for, after a few moments, he said to Mr. Fogg, "These are long and slow hours, sir, that we are passing on the railway."

2810
05:15:13,560 --> 05:15:17,041
"Yes," replied Mr. Fogg; "but they pass."

2811
05:15:17,521 --> 05:15:21,800
"You were in the habit of playing whist," resumed Fix, "on the steamers."

2812
05:15:22,640 --> 05:15:25,879
"Yes; but it would be difficult to do so here.

2813
05:15:25,900 --> 05:15:28,139
I have neither cards nor partners."

2814
05:15:28,620 --> 05:15:34,060
"Oh, but we can easily buy some cards, for they are sold on all the American trains.

2815
05:15:34,080 --> 05:15:36,780
And as for partners, if madam plays--"

2816
05:15:37,120 --> 05:15:41,980
"Certainly, sir," Aouda quickly replied; "I understand whist.

2817
05:15:42,340 --> 05:15:44,400
It is part of an English education."

2818
05:15:45,080 --> 05:15:48,240
"I myself have some pretensions to playing a good game.

2819
05:15:48,719 --> 05:15:51,100
Well, here are three of us, and a dummy--"

2820
05:15:51,880 --> 05:15:58,860
"As you please, sir," replied Phileas Fogg, heartily glad to resume his favourite pastime even on the railway.

2821
05:15:59,780 --> 05:16:08,900
Passepartout was dispatched in search of the steward, and soon returned with two packs of cards, some pins, counters, and a shelf covered with cloth.

2822
05:16:09,361 --> 05:16:10,400
The game commenced.

2823
05:16:10,660 --> 05:16:17,360
Aouda understood whist sufficiently well, and even received some compliments on her playing from Mr. Fogg.

2824
05:16:18,180 --> 05:16:24,740
As for the detective, he was simply an adept, and worthy of being matched against his present opponent.

2825
05:16:25,860 --> 05:16:28,580
"Now," thought Passepartout, "we've got him.

2826
05:16:28,900 --> 05:16:30,240
He won't budge."

2827
05:16:31,160 --> 05:16:45,800
At eleven in the morning the train had reached the dividing ridge of the waters at Bridger Pass, seven thousand five hundred and twenty-four feet above the level of the sea, one of the highest points attained by the track in crossing the Rocky Mountains.

2828
05:16:46,560 --> 05:16:59,180
After going about two hundred miles, the travellers at last found themselves on one of those vast plains which extend to the Atlantic, and which nature has made so propitious for laying the iron road.

2829
05:17:00,120 --> 05:17:07,580
On the declivity of the Atlantic basin the first streams, branches of the North Platte River, already appeared.

2830
05:17:08,080 --> 05:17:19,360
The whole northern and eastern horizon was bounded by the immense semi-circular curtain which is formed by the southern portion of the Rocky Mountains, the highest being Laramie Peak.

2831
05:17:20,121 --> 05:17:24,781
Between this and the railway extended vast plains, plentifully irrigated.

2832
05:17:25,521 --> 05:17:35,220
On the right rose the lower spurs of the mountainous mass which extends southward to the sources of the Arkansas River, one of the great tributaries of the Missouri.

2833
05:17:36,080 --> 05:17:45,980
At half-past twelve the travellers caught sight for an instant of Fort Halleck, which commands that section; and in a few more hours the Rocky Mountains were crossed.

2834
05:17:46,600 --> 05:17:51,700
There was reason to hope, then, that no accident would mark the journey through this difficult country.

2835
05:17:52,139 --> 05:17:56,400
The snow had ceased falling, and the air became crisp and cold.

2836
05:17:57,120 --> 05:18:01,541
Large birds, frightened by the locomotive, rose and flew off in the distance.

2837
05:18:02,000 --> 05:18:04,080
No wild beast appeared on the plain.

2838
05:18:04,740 --> 05:18:07,480
It was a desert in its vast nakedness.

2839
05:18:08,580 --> 05:18:18,820
After a comfortable breakfast, served in the car, Mr. Fogg and his partners had just resumed whist, when a violent whistling was heard, and the train stopped.

2840
05:18:19,440 --> 05:18:25,480
Passepartout put his head out of the door, but saw nothing to cause the delay; no station was in view.

2841
05:18:26,440 --> 05:18:36,460
Aouda and Fix feared that Mr. Fogg might take it into his head to get out; but that gentleman contented himself with saying to his servant, "See what is the matter."

2842
05:18:37,080 --> 05:18:38,840
Passepartout rushed out of the car.

2843
05:18:39,220 --> 05:18:44,660
Thirty or forty passengers had already descended, amongst them Colonel Stamp Proctor.

2844
05:18:45,260 --> 05:18:48,580
The train had stopped before a red signal which blocked the way.

2845
05:18:48,860 --> 05:18:57,820
The engineer and conductor were talking excitedly with a signal-man, whom the station-master at Medicine Bow, the next stopping place, had sent on before.

2846
05:18:58,300 --> 05:19:05,760
The passengers drew around and took part in the discussion, in which Colonel Proctor, with his insolent manner, was conspicuous.

2847
05:19:06,640 --> 05:19:10,180
Passepartout, joining the group, heard the signal-man say, "No!

2848
05:19:10,398 --> 05:19:11,500
you can't pass.

2849
05:19:11,799 --> 05:19:15,960
The bridge at Medicine Bow is shaky, and would not bear the weight of the train."

2850
05:19:16,639 --> 05:19:22,080
This was a suspension-bridge thrown over some rapids, about a mile from the place where they now were.

2851
05:19:22,840 --> 05:19:31,500
According to the signal-man, it was in a ruinous condition, several of the iron wires being broken; and it was impossible to risk the passage.

2852
05:19:32,260 --> 05:19:35,559
He did not in any way exaggerate the condition of the bridge.

2853
05:19:36,140 --> 05:19:42,800
It may be taken for granted that, rash as the Americans usually are, when they are prudent there is good reason for it.

2854
05:19:43,400 --> 05:19:50,880
Passepartout, not daring to apprise his master of what he heard, listened with set teeth, immovable as a statue.

2855
05:19:51,660 --> 05:19:52,160
"Hum!"

2856
05:19:52,541 --> 05:19:58,460
cried Colonel Proctor; "but we are not going to stay here, I imagine, and take root in the snow?"

2857
05:19:59,020 --> 05:20:09,200
"Colonel," replied the conductor, "we have telegraphed to Omaha for a train, but it is not likely that it will reach Medicine Bow in less than six hours."

2858
05:20:09,700 --> 05:20:10,700
"Six hours!"

2859
05:20:10,880 --> 05:20:11,760
cried Passepartout.

2860
05:20:12,320 --> 05:20:19,520
"Certainly," returned the conductor, "besides, it will take us as long as that to reach Medicine Bow on foot."

2861
05:20:20,180 --> 05:20:23,780
"But it is only a mile from here," said one of the passengers.

2862
05:20:24,240 --> 05:20:26,379
"Yes, but it's on the other side of the river."

2863
05:20:26,440 --> 05:20:29,500
"And can't we cross that in a boat?"

2864
05:20:29,520 --> 05:20:30,201
asked the colonel.

2865
05:20:30,780 --> 05:20:31,799
"That's impossible.

2866
05:20:32,139 --> 05:20:34,340
The creek is swelled by the rains.

2867
05:20:34,500 --> 05:20:39,680
It is a rapid, and we shall have to make a circuit of ten miles to the north to find a ford."

2868
05:20:40,340 --> 05:20:50,602
The colonel launched a volley of oaths, denouncing the railway company and the conductor; and Passepartout, who was furious, was not disinclined to make common cause with him.

2869
05:20:51,060 --> 05:20:56,120
Here was an obstacle, indeed, which all his master's banknotes could not remove.

2870
05:20:57,120 --> 05:21:06,940
There was a general disappointment among the passengers, who, without reckoning the delay, saw themselves compelled to trudge fifteen miles over a plain covered with snow.

2871
05:21:07,400 --> 05:21:16,060
They grumbled and protested, and would certainly have thus attracted Phileas Fogg's attention if he had not been completely absorbed in his game.

2872
05:21:16,820 --> 05:21:32,201
Passepartout found that he could not avoid telling his master what had occurred, and, with hanging head, he was turning towards the car, when the engineer, a true Yankee, named Forster called out, "Gentlemen, perhaps there is a way, after all, to get over."

2873
05:21:32,740 --> 05:21:33,780
"On the bridge?"

2874
05:21:33,800 --> 05:21:34,600
asked a passenger.

2875
05:21:35,000 --> 05:21:35,959
"On the bridge."

2876
05:21:36,400 --> 05:21:37,280
"With our train?"

2877
05:21:37,920 --> 05:21:38,840
"With our train."

2878
05:21:39,500 --> 05:21:42,760
Passepartout stopped short, and eagerly listened to the engineer.

2879
05:21:43,420 --> 05:21:46,180
"But the bridge is unsafe," urged the conductor.

2880
05:21:46,980 --> 05:21:54,140
"No matter," replied Forster; "I think that by putting on the very highest speed we might have a chance of getting over."

2881
05:21:54,660 --> 05:21:55,360
"The devil!"

2882
05:21:55,701 --> 05:21:56,860
muttered Passepartout.

2883
05:21:57,280 --> 05:22:07,280
But a number of the passengers were at once attracted by the engineer's proposal, and Colonel Proctor was especially delighted, and found the plan a very feasible one.

2884
05:22:07,861 --> 05:22:18,541
He told stories about engineers leaping their trains over rivers without bridges, by putting on full steam; and many of those present avowed themselves of the engineer's mind.

2885
05:22:19,281 --> 05:22:22,959
"We have fifty chances out of a hundred of getting over," said one.

2886
05:22:23,480 --> 05:22:24,059
"Eighty!

2887
05:22:24,460 --> 05:22:24,940
ninety!"

2888
05:22:25,520 --> 05:22:33,880
Passepartout was astounded, and, though ready to attempt anything to get over Medicine Creek, thought the experiment proposed a little too American.

2889
05:22:34,460 --> 05:22:40,121
"Besides," thought he, "there's a still more simple way, and it does not even occur to any of these people!

2890
05:22:40,960 --> 05:22:46,860
Sir," said he aloud to one of the passengers, "the engineer's plan seems to me a little dangerous, but--"

2891
05:22:47,400 --> 05:22:48,800
"Eighty chances!"

2892
05:22:49,020 --> 05:22:51,340
replied the passenger, turning his back on him.

2893
05:22:51,920 --> 05:22:56,400
"I know it," said Passepartout, turning to another passenger, "but a simple idea--"

2894
05:22:56,780 --> 05:23:04,140
"Ideas are no use," returned the American, shrugging his shoulders, "as the engineer assures us that we can pass."

2895
05:23:04,580 --> 05:23:09,480
"Doubtless," urged Passepartout, "we can pass, but perhaps it would be more prudent--"

2896
05:23:09,700 --> 05:23:10,160
"What!

2897
05:23:10,380 --> 05:23:10,900
Prudent!"

2898
05:23:11,280 --> 05:23:15,400
cried Colonel Proctor, whom this word seemed to excite prodigiously.

2899
05:23:16,000 --> 05:23:19,800
"At full speed, don't you see, at full speed!"

2900
05:23:20,299 --> 05:23:29,240
"I know--I see," repeated Passepartout; "but it would be, if not more prudent, since that word displeases you, at least more natural--"

2901
05:23:29,480 --> 05:23:29,480
"Who!

2902
05:23:29,480 --> 05:23:30,440
What!

2903
05:23:30,799 --> 05:23:32,580
What's the matter with this fellow?"

2904
05:23:32,799 --> 05:23:33,521
cried several.

2905
05:23:34,041 --> 05:23:37,080
The poor fellow did not know to whom to address himself.

2906
05:23:37,680 --> 05:23:39,020
"Are you afraid?"

2907
05:23:39,340 --> 05:23:40,281
asked Colonel Proctor.

2908
05:23:40,700 --> 05:23:41,541
"I afraid?

2909
05:23:41,580 --> 05:23:46,680
Very well; I will show these people that a Frenchman can be as American as they!"

2910
05:23:47,600 --> 05:23:48,600
"All aboard!"

2911
05:23:48,940 --> 05:23:49,800
cried the conductor.

2912
05:23:50,360 --> 05:23:51,621
"Yes, all aboard!"

2913
05:23:51,940 --> 05:23:54,000
repeated Passepartout, and immediately.

2914
05:23:54,520 --> 05:24:01,420
"But they can't prevent me from thinking that it would be more natural for us to cross the bridge on foot, and let the train come after!"

2915
05:24:01,920 --> 05:24:06,780
But no one heard this sage reflection, nor would anyone have acknowledged its justice.

2916
05:24:07,360 --> 05:24:10,102
The passengers resumed their places in the cars.

2917
05:24:10,621 --> 05:24:13,820
Passepartout took his seat without telling what had passed.

2918
05:24:14,541 --> 05:24:17,260
The whist-players were quite absorbed in their game.

2919
05:24:18,320 --> 05:24:28,520
The locomotive whistled vigorously; the engineer, reversing the steam, backed the train for nearly a mile--retiring, like a jumper, in order to take a longer leap.

2920
05:24:29,380 --> 05:24:44,120
Then, with another whistle, he began to move forward; the train increased its speed, and soon its rapidity became frightful; a prolonged screech issued from the locomotive; the piston worked up and down twenty strokes to the second.

2921
05:24:44,840 --> 05:24:51,459
They perceived that the whole train, rushing on at the rate of a hundred miles an hour, hardly bore upon the rails at all.

2922
05:24:52,260 --> 05:24:53,740
And they passed over!

2923
05:24:53,760 --> 05:24:55,200
It was like a flash.

2924
05:24:55,541 --> 05:24:56,860
No one saw the bridge.

2925
05:24:57,040 --> 05:25:05,500
The train leaped, so to speak, from one bank to the other, and the engineer could not stop it until it had gone five miles beyond the station.

2926
05:25:06,180 --> 05:25:13,640
But scarcely had the train passed the river, when the bridge, completely ruined, fell with a crash into the rapids of Medicine Bow.

2927

Around the World in Eighty Days

2931
05:25:35,090 --> 05:25:38,330
Translated by George Makepeace Towle

2932
05:25:38,330 --> 05:25:40,140
Chapter 29

2933
05:25:40,140 --> 05:25:46,871
IN WHICH CERTAIN INCIDENTS ARE NARRATED WHICH ARE ONLY TO BE MET WITH ON AMERICAN RAILROADS

2934
05:25:47,380 --> 05:25:55,880
The train pursued its course, that evening, without interruption, passing Fort Saunders, crossing Cheyne Pass, and reaching Evans Pass.

2935
05:25:56,379 --> 05:26:03,020
The road here attained the highest elevation of the journey, eight thousand and ninety-two feet above the level of the sea.

2936
05:26:03,520 --> 05:26:09,160
The travellers had now only to descend to the Atlantic by limitless plains, levelled by nature.

2937
05:26:09,799 --> 05:26:14,660
A branch of the "grand trunk" led off southward to Denver, the capital of Colorado.

2938
05:26:15,200 --> 05:26:21,980
The country round about is rich in gold and silver, and more than fifty thousand inhabitants are already settled there.

2939
05:26:23,380 --> 05:26:34,080
Thirteen hundred and eighty-two miles had been passed over from San Francisco, in three days and three nights; four days and nights more would probably bring them to New York.

2940
05:26:34,820 --> 05:26:37,340
Phileas Fogg was not as yet behind-hand.

2941
05:26:38,740 --> 05:26:49,541
During the night Camp Walbach was passed on the left; Lodge Pole Creek ran parallel with the road, marking the boundary between the territories of Wyoming and Colorado.

2942
05:26:50,102 --> 05:26:57,240
They entered Nebraska at eleven, passed near Sedgwick, and touched at Julesburg, on the southern branch of the Platte River.

2943
05:26:58,000 --> 05:27:06,460
It was here that the Union Pacific Railroad was inaugurated on the 23rd of October, 1867, by the chief engineer, General Dodge.

2944
05:27:06,920 --> 05:27:13,020
Two powerful locomotives, carrying nine cars of invited guests, amongst whom was Thomas C.

2945
05:27:13,041 --> 05:27:29,160
Durant, vice-president of the road, stopped at this point; cheers were given, the Sioux and Pawnees performed an imitation Indian battle, fireworks were let off, and the first number of the Railway Pioneer was printed by a press brought on the train.

2946
05:27:30,200 --> 05:27:43,160
Thus was celebrated the inauguration of this great railroad, a mighty instrument of progress and civilisation, thrown across the desert, and destined to link together cities and towns which do not yet exist.

2947
05:27:44,080 --> 05:27:51,000
The whistle of the locomotive, more powerful than Amphion's lyre, was about to bid them rise from American soil.

2948
05:27:52,160 --> 05:28:00,059
Fort McPherson was left behind at eight in the morning, and three hundred and fifty-seven miles had yet to be traversed before reaching Omaha.

2949
05:28:00,879 --> 05:28:07,541
The road followed the capricious windings of the southern branch of the Platte River, on its left bank.

2950
05:28:07,680 --> 05:28:22,400
At nine the train stopped at the important town of North Platte, built between the two arms of the river, which rejoin each other around it and form a single artery, a large tributary, whose waters empty into the Missouri a little above Omaha.

2951
05:28:22,420 --> 05:28:26,180
The one hundred and first meridian was passed.

2952
05:28:26,820 --> 05:28:33,580
Mr. Fogg and his partners had resumed their game; no one--not even the dummy--complained of the length of the trip.

2953
05:28:34,360 --> 05:28:42,900
Fix had begun by winning several guineas, which he seemed likely to lose; but he showed himself a not less eager whist-player than Mr. Fogg.

2954
05:28:43,920 --> 05:28:47,180
During the morning, chance distinctly favoured that gentleman.

2955
05:28:47,680 --> 05:28:50,480
Trumps and honours were showered upon his hands.

2956
05:28:50,880 --> 05:28:59,420
Once, having resolved on a bold stroke, he was on the point of playing a spade, when a voice behind him said, "I should play a diamond."

2957
05:29:00,260 --> 05:29:04,440
Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Fix raised their heads, and beheld Colonel Proctor.

2958
05:29:05,160 --> 05:29:09,420
Stamp Proctor and Phileas Fogg recognised each other at once.

2959
05:29:09,860 --> 05:29:10,441
"Ah!

2960
05:29:10,639 --> 05:29:12,520
it's you, is it, Englishman?"

2961
05:29:12,900 --> 05:29:16,201
cried the colonel; "it's you who are going to play a spade!"

2962
05:29:16,980 --> 05:29:21,820
"And who plays it," replied Phileas Fogg coolly, throwing down the ten of spades.

2963
05:29:22,340 --> 05:29:27,660
"Well, it pleases me to have it diamonds," replied Colonel Proctor, in an insolent tone.

2964
05:29:28,500 --> 05:29:35,560
He made a movement as if to seize the card which had just been played, adding, "You don't understand anything about whist."

2965
05:29:36,260 --> 05:29:40,820
"Perhaps I do, as well as another," said Phileas Fogg, rising.

2966
05:29:41,420 --> 05:29:45,880
"You have only to try, son of John Bull," replied the colonel.

2967
05:29:46,800 --> 05:29:49,219
Aouda turned pale, and her blood ran cold.

2968
05:29:49,860 --> 05:29:52,520
She seized Mr. Fogg's arm and gently pulled him back.

2969
05:29:53,020 --> 05:29:57,898
Passepartout was ready to pounce upon the American, who was staring insolently at his opponent.

2970
05:29:58,360 --> 05:30:08,340
But Fix got up, and, going to Colonel Proctor said, "You forget that it is I with whom you have to deal, sir; for it was I whom you not only insulted, but struck!"

2971
05:30:09,020 --> 05:30:15,040
"Mr. Fix," said Mr. Fogg, "pardon me, but this affair is mine, and mine only.

2972
05:30:15,780 --> 05:30:23,320
The colonel has again insulted me, by insisting that I should not play a spade, and he shall give me satisfaction for it."

2973
05:30:23,720 --> 05:30:29,100
"When and where you will," replied the American, "and with whatever weapon you choose."

2974
05:30:29,980 --> 05:30:37,060
Aouda in vain attempted to retain Mr. Fogg; as vainly did the detective endeavour to make the quarrel his.

2975
05:30:37,660 --> 05:30:42,059
Passepartout wished to throw the colonel out of the window, but a sign from his master checked him.

2976
05:30:42,840 --> 05:30:47,340
Phileas Fogg left the car, and the American followed him upon the platform.

2977
05:30:48,100 --> 05:30:57,620
"Sir," said Mr. Fogg to his adversary, "I am in a great hurry to get back to Europe, and any delay whatever will be greatly to my disadvantage."

2978
05:30:58,041 --> 05:30:59,560
"Well, what's that to me?"

2979
05:31:00,000 --> 05:31:01,100
replied Colonel Proctor.

2980
05:31:01,740 --> 05:31:13,820
"Sir," said Mr. Fogg, very politely, "after our meeting at San Francisco, I determined to return to America and find you as soon as I had completed the business which called me to England."

2981
05:31:14,380 --> 05:31:14,940
"Really!"

2982
05:31:15,540 --> 05:31:18,180
"Will you appoint a meeting for six months hence?"

2983
05:31:18,920 --> 05:31:20,860
"Why not ten years hence?"

2984
05:31:21,480 --> 05:31:26,780
"I say six months," returned Phileas Fogg; "and I shall be at the place of meeting promptly."

2985
05:31:27,320 --> 05:31:30,620
"All this is an evasion," cried Stamp Proctor.

2986
05:31:31,200 --> 05:31:32,540
"Now or never!"

2987
05:31:33,719 --> 05:31:34,200
"Very good.

2988
05:31:34,621 --> 05:31:35,860
You are going to New York?"

2989
05:31:36,361 --> 05:31:36,760
"No."

2990
05:31:37,180 --> 05:31:37,900
"To Chicago?"

2991
05:31:38,479 --> 05:31:38,940
"No."

2992
05:31:39,500 --> 05:31:40,479
"To Omaha?"

2993
05:31:41,300 --> 05:31:42,660
"What difference is it to you?

2994
05:31:43,180 --> 05:31:44,460
Do you know Plum Creek?"

2995
05:31:45,260 --> 05:31:46,960
"No," replied Mr. Fogg.

2996
05:31:47,860 --> 05:31:49,180
"It's the next station.

2997
05:31:49,600 --> 05:31:53,460
The train will be there in an hour, and will stop there ten minutes.

2998
05:31:53,980 --> 05:31:57,520
In ten minutes several revolver-shots could be exchanged."

2999
05:31:58,320 --> 05:32:00,180
"Very well," said Mr. Fogg.

3000
05:32:00,640 --> 05:32:02,300
"I will stop at Plum Creek."

3001
05:32:02,960 --> 05:32:07,559
"And I guess you'll stay there too," added the American insolently.

3002
05:32:08,299 --> 05:32:09,100
"Who knows?"

3003
05:32:09,520 --> 05:32:13,040
replied Mr. Fogg, returning to the car as coolly as usual.

3004
05:32:14,020 --> 05:32:25,959
He began to reassure Aouda, telling her that blusterers were never to be feared, and begged Fix to be his second at the approaching duel, a request which the detective could not refuse.

3005
05:32:26,920 --> 05:32:30,660
Mr. Fogg resumed the interrupted game with perfect calmness.

3006
05:32:31,540 --> 05:32:36,898
At eleven o'clock the locomotive's whistle announced that they were approaching Plum Creek station.

3007
05:32:37,660 --> 05:32:41,621
Mr. Fogg rose, and, followed by Fix, went out upon the platform.

3008
05:32:42,240 --> 05:32:45,480
Passepartout accompanied him, carrying a pair of revolvers.

3009
05:32:45,920 --> 05:32:49,000
Aouda remained in the car, as pale as death.

3010
05:32:49,799 --> 05:32:57,320
The door of the next car opened, and Colonel Proctor appeared on the platform, attended by a Yankee of his own stamp as his second.

3011
05:32:58,200 --> 05:33:05,340
But just as the combatants were about to step from the train, the conductor hurried up, and shouted, "You can't get off, gentlemen!"

3012
05:33:05,920 --> 05:33:06,740
"Why not?"

3013
05:33:07,041 --> 05:33:07,701
asked the colonel.

3014
05:33:08,360 --> 05:33:11,240
"We are twenty minutes late, and we shall not stop."

3015
05:33:11,740 --> 05:33:14,560
"But I am going to fight a duel with this gentleman."

3016
05:33:15,240 --> 05:33:19,560
"I am sorry," said the conductor; "but we shall be off at once.

3017
05:33:19,740 --> 05:33:21,340
There's the bell ringing now."

3018
05:33:21,861 --> 05:33:22,920
The train started.

3019
05:33:23,600 --> 05:33:26,719
"I'm really very sorry, gentlemen," said the conductor.

3020
05:33:27,120 --> 05:33:30,760
"Under any other circumstances I should have been happy to oblige you.

3021
05:33:31,500 --> 05:33:36,480
But, after all, as you have not had time to fight here, why not fight as we go along?"

3022
05:33:37,059 --> 05:33:42,240
"That wouldn't be convenient, perhaps, for this gentleman," said the colonel, in a jeering tone.

3023
05:33:43,040 --> 05:33:46,102
"It would be perfectly so," replied Phileas Fogg.

3024
05:33:46,680 --> 05:33:52,460
"Well, we are really in America," thought Passepartout, "and the conductor is a gentleman of the first order!"

3025
05:33:53,400 --> 05:33:55,340
So muttering, he followed his master.

3026
05:33:56,180 --> 05:34:01,080
The two combatants, their seconds, and the conductor passed through the cars to the rear of the train.

3027
05:34:02,080 --> 05:34:13,940
The last car was only occupied by a dozen passengers, whom the conductor politely asked if they would not be so kind as to leave it vacant for a few moments, as two gentlemen had an affair of honour to settle.

3028
05:34:14,960 --> 05:34:20,040
The passengers granted the request with alacrity, and straightway disappeared on the platform.

3029
05:34:21,281 --> 05:34:25,500
The car, which was some fifty feet long, was very convenient for their purpose.

3030
05:34:26,020 --> 05:34:30,680
The adversaries might march on each other in the aisle, and fire at their ease.

3031
05:34:31,180 --> 05:34:33,740
Never was duel more easily arranged.

3032
05:34:34,361 --> 05:34:39,861
Mr. Fogg and Colonel Proctor, each provided with two six-barrelled revolvers, entered the car.

3033
05:34:40,440 --> 05:34:42,920
The seconds, remaining outside, shut them in.

3034
05:34:43,380 --> 05:34:46,860
They were to begin firing at the first whistle of the locomotive.

3035
05:34:46,880 --> 05:34:52,060
After an interval of two minutes, what remained of the two gentlemen would be taken from the car.

3036
05:34:52,700 --> 05:34:54,320
Nothing could be more simple.

3037
05:34:54,340 --> 05:35:00,521
Indeed, it was all so simple that Fix and Passepartout felt their hearts beating as if they would crack.

3038
05:35:01,280 --> 05:35:12,020
They were listening for the whistle agreed upon, when suddenly savage cries resounded in the air, accompanied by reports which certainly did not issue from the car where the duellists were.

3039
05:35:12,820 --> 05:35:16,060
The reports continued in front and the whole length of the train.

3040
05:35:16,500 --> 05:35:20,060
Cries of terror proceeded from the interior of the cars.

3041
05:35:20,639 --> 05:35:28,660
Colonel Proctor and Mr. Fogg, revolvers in hand, hastily quitted their prison, and rushed forward where the noise was most clamorous.

3042
05:35:29,320 --> 05:35:32,960
They then perceived that the train was attacked by a band of Sioux.

3043
05:35:33,701 --> 05:35:40,480
This was not the first attempt of these daring Indians, for more than once they had waylaid trains on the road.

3044
05:35:40,500 --> 05:35:48,680
A hundred of them had, according to their habit, jumped upon the steps without stopping the train, with the ease of a clown mounting a horse at full gallop.

3045
05:35:49,260 --> 05:35:58,400
The Sioux were armed with guns, from which came the reports, to which the passengers, who were almost all armed, responded by revolver-shots.

3046
05:35:58,840 --> 05:36:05,200
The Indians had first mounted the engine, and half stunned the engineer and stoker with blows from their muskets.

3047
05:36:05,760 --> 05:36:17,799
A Sioux chief, wishing to stop the train, but not knowing how to work the regulator, had opened wide instead of closing the steam-valve, and the locomotive was plunging forward with terrific velocity.

3048
05:36:18,320 --> 05:36:28,140
The Sioux had at the same time invaded the cars, skipping like enraged monkeys over the roofs, thrusting open the doors, and fighting hand to hand with the passengers.

3049
05:36:28,500 --> 05:36:32,940
Penetrating the baggage-car, they pillaged it, throwing the trunks out of the train.

3050
05:36:33,620 --> 05:36:35,640
The cries and shots were constant.

3051
05:36:36,041 --> 05:36:46,201
The travellers defended themselves bravely; some of the cars were barricaded, and sustained a siege, like moving forts, carried along at a speed of a hundred miles an hour.

3052
05:36:46,660 --> 05:36:49,280
Aouda behaved courageously from the first.

3053
05:36:49,560 --> 05:36:57,180
She defended herself like a true heroine with a revolver, which she shot through the broken windows whenever a savage made his appearance.

3054
05:36:57,700 --> 05:37:05,320
Twenty Sioux had fallen mortally wounded to the ground, and the wheels crushed those who fell upon the rails as if they had been worms.

3055
05:37:05,820 --> 05:37:09,080
Several passengers, shot or stunned, lay on the seats.

3056
05:37:09,540 --> 05:37:18,398
It was necessary to put an end to the struggle, which had lasted for ten minutes, and which would result in the triumph of the Sioux if the train was not stopped.

3057
05:37:18,959 --> 05:37:29,621
Fort Kearney station, where there was a garrison, was only two miles distant; but, that once passed, the Sioux would be masters of the train between Fort Kearney and the station beyond.

3058
05:37:30,281 --> 05:37:34,219
The conductor was fighting beside Mr. Fogg, when he was shot and fell.

3059
05:37:34,240 --> 05:37:40,041
At the same moment he cried, "Unless the train is stopped in five minutes, we are lost!"

3060
05:37:40,820 --> 05:37:45,160
"It shall be stopped," said Phileas Fogg, preparing to rush from the car.

3061
05:37:45,621 --> 05:37:48,740
"Stay, monsieur," cried Passepartout; "I will go."

3062
05:37:49,460 --> 05:38:19,680
Mr. Fogg had not time to stop the brave fellow, who, opening a door unperceived by the Indians, succeeded in slipping under the car; and while the struggle continued and the balls whizzed across each other over his head, he made use of his old acrobatic experience, and with amazing agility worked his way under the cars, holding on to the chains, aiding himself by the brakes and edges of the sashes, creeping from one car to another with marvellous skill, and thus gaining the forward end of the train.

3063
05:38:20,600 --> 05:38:35,479
There, suspended by one hand between the baggage-car and the tender, with the other he loosened the safety chains; but, owing to the traction, he would never have succeeded in unscrewing the yoking-bar, had not a violent concussion jolted this bar out.

3064
05:38:35,820 --> 05:38:43,180
The train, now detached from the engine, remained a little behind, whilst the locomotive rushed forward with increased speed.

3065
05:38:44,080 --> 05:38:54,740
Carried on by the force already acquired, the train still moved for several minutes; but the brakes were worked and at last they stopped, less than a hundred feet from Kearney station.

3066
05:38:55,280 --> 05:39:04,621
The soldiers of the fort, attracted by the shots, hurried up; the Sioux had not expected them, and decamped in a body before the train entirely stopped.

3067
05:39:05,040 --> 05:39:16,340
But when the passengers counted each other on the station platform several were found missing; among others the courageous Frenchman, whose devotion had just saved them.

3068

Chapter 30

3074
05:39:41,710 --> 05:39:45,469
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SIMPLY DOES HIS DUTY

3075
05:39:46,200 --> 05:39:49,521
Three passengers including Passepartout had disappeared.

3076
05:39:50,280 --> 05:39:51,860
Had they been killed in the struggle?

3077
05:39:52,600 --> 05:39:55,380
Were they taken prisoners by the Sioux?

3078
05:39:55,400 --> 05:39:57,000
It was impossible to tell.

3079
05:39:58,160 --> 05:40:00,460
There were many wounded, but none mortally.

3080
05:40:01,420 --> 05:40:07,420
Colonel Proctor was one of the most seriously hurt; he had fought bravely, and a ball had entered his groin.

3081
05:40:08,240 --> 05:40:14,500
He was carried into the station with the other wounded passengers, to receive such attention as could be of avail.

3082
05:40:15,720 --> 05:40:22,140
Aouda was safe; and Phileas Fogg, who had been in the thickest of the fight, had not received a scratch.

3083
05:40:23,040 --> 05:40:25,240
Fix was slightly wounded in the arm.

3084
05:40:25,780 --> 05:40:31,560
But Passepartout was not to be found, and tears coursed down Aouda's cheeks.

3085
05:40:32,920 --> 05:40:37,920
All the passengers had got out of the train, the wheels of which were stained with blood.

3086
05:40:38,400 --> 05:40:41,920
From the tyres and spokes hung ragged pieces of flesh.

3087
05:40:42,460 --> 05:40:47,500
As far as the eye could reach on the white plain behind, red trails were visible.

3088
05:40:48,480 --> 05:40:53,220
The last Sioux were disappearing in the south, along the banks of Republican River.

3089
05:40:53,960 --> 05:40:56,780
Mr. Fogg, with folded arms, remained motionless.

3090
05:40:57,541 --> 05:40:59,380
He had a serious decision to make.

3091
05:40:59,959 --> 05:41:05,480
Aouda, standing near him, looked at him without speaking, and he understood her look.

3092
05:41:05,520 --> 05:41:11,140
If his servant was a prisoner, ought he not to risk everything to rescue him from the Indians?

3093
05:41:11,860 --> 05:41:15,980
"I will find him, living or dead," said he quietly to Aouda.

3094
05:41:16,660 --> 05:41:18,580
"Ah, Mr.--Mr. Fogg!"

3095
05:41:19,060 --> 05:41:22,740
cried she, clasping his hands and covering them with tears.

3096
05:41:23,260 --> 05:41:27,200
"Living," added Mr. Fogg, "if we do not lose a moment."

3097
05:41:27,960 --> 05:41:33,879
Phileas Fogg, by this resolution, inevitably sacrificed himself; he pronounced his own doom.

3098
05:41:34,460 --> 05:41:41,480
The delay of a single day would make him lose the steamer at New York, and his bet would be certainly lost.

3099
05:41:42,120 --> 05:41:45,760
But as he thought, "It is my duty," he did not hesitate.

3100
05:41:46,600 --> 05:41:49,080
The commanding officer of Fort Kearney was there.

3101
05:41:49,660 --> 05:41:55,640
A hundred of his soldiers had placed themselves in a position to defend the station, should the Sioux attack it.

3102
05:41:56,120 --> 05:42:00,260
"Sir," said Mr. Fogg to the captain, "three passengers have disappeared."

3103
05:42:00,960 --> 05:42:01,460
"Dead?"

3104
05:42:01,780 --> 05:42:02,479
asked the captain.

3105
05:42:03,040 --> 05:42:07,460
"Dead or prisoners; that is the uncertainty which must be solved.

3106
05:42:08,240 --> 05:42:09,900
Do you propose to pursue the Sioux?"

3107
05:42:10,840 --> 05:42:14,459
"That's a serious thing to do, sir," returned the captain.

3108
05:42:15,080 --> 05:42:21,201
"These Indians may retreat beyond the Arkansas, and I cannot leave the fort unprotected."

3109
05:42:21,959 --> 05:42:25,820
"The lives of three men are in question, sir," said Phileas Fogg.

3110
05:42:26,320 --> 05:42:31,180
"Doubtless; but can I risk the lives of fifty men to save three?"

3111
05:42:31,760 --> 05:42:35,020
"I don't know whether you can, sir; but you ought to do so."

3112
05:42:35,580 --> 05:42:39,700
"Nobody here," returned the other, "has a right to teach me my duty."

3113
05:42:40,440 --> 05:42:42,520
"Very well," said Mr. Fogg, coldly.

3114
05:42:42,781 --> 05:42:43,680
"I will go alone."

3115
05:42:44,300 --> 05:42:44,760
"You, sir!"

3116
05:42:45,280 --> 05:42:48,920
cried Fix, coming up; "you go alone in pursuit of the Indians?"

3117
05:42:49,460 --> 05:42:55,660
"Would you have me leave this poor fellow to perish--him to whom every one present owes his life?

3118
05:42:55,760 --> 05:42:56,520
I shall go."

3119
05:42:57,140 --> 05:43:02,020
"No, sir, you shall not go alone," cried the captain, touched in spite of himself.

3120
05:43:02,360 --> 05:43:02,701
"No!

3121
05:43:03,200 --> 05:43:04,900
you are a brave man.

3122
05:43:04,900 --> 05:43:06,200
Thirty volunteers!"

3123
05:43:06,320 --> 05:43:07,880
he added, turning to the soldiers.

3124
05:43:07,900 --> 05:43:10,680
The whole company started forward at once.

3125
05:43:11,121 --> 05:43:13,020
The captain had only to pick his men.

3126
05:43:13,920 --> 05:43:17,180
Thirty were chosen, and an old sergeant placed at their head.

3127
05:43:17,940 --> 05:43:19,900
"Thanks, captain," said Mr. Fogg.

3128
05:43:20,420 --> 05:43:21,720
"Will you let me go with you?"

3129
05:43:22,219 --> 05:43:23,000
asked Fix.

3130
05:43:23,621 --> 05:43:24,660
"Do as you please, sir.

3131
05:43:24,900 --> 05:43:28,380
But if you wish to do me a favour, you will remain with Aouda.

3132
05:43:28,700 --> 05:43:30,320
In case anything should happen to me--"

3133
05:43:30,840 --> 05:43:33,840
A sudden pallor overspread the detective's face.

3134
05:43:34,560 --> 05:43:39,820
Separate himself from the man whom he had so persistently followed step by step!

3135
05:43:39,860 --> 05:43:42,000
Leave him to wander about in this desert!

3136
05:43:42,860 --> 05:43:52,660
Fix gazed attentively at Mr. Fogg, and, despite his suspicions and of the struggle which was going on within him, he lowered his eyes before that calm and frank look.

3137
05:43:53,240 --> 05:43:55,040
"I will stay," said he.

3138
05:43:55,980 --> 05:44:05,480
A few moments after, Mr. Fogg pressed the young woman's hand, and, having confided to her his precious carpet-bag, went off with the sergeant and his little squad.

3139
05:44:06,080 --> 05:44:14,201
But, before going, he had said to the soldiers, "My friends, I will divide five thousand dollars among you, if we save the prisoners."

3140
05:44:14,720 --> 05:44:16,400
It was then a little past noon.

3141
05:44:17,400 --> 05:44:26,460
Aouda retired to a waiting-room, and there she waited alone, thinking of the simple and noble generosity, the tranquil courage of Phileas Fogg.

3142
05:44:27,400 --> 05:44:35,701
He had sacrificed his fortune, and was now risking his life, all without hesitation, from duty, in silence.

3143
05:44:36,560 --> 05:44:41,120
Fix did not have the same thoughts, and could scarcely conceal his agitation.

3144
05:44:41,660 --> 05:44:47,121
He walked feverishly up and down the platform, but soon resumed his outward composure.

3145
05:44:47,660 --> 05:44:51,719
He now saw the folly of which he had been guilty in letting Fogg go alone.

3146
05:44:52,180 --> 05:44:52,560
What!

3147
05:44:52,740 --> 05:44:58,560
This man, whom he had just followed around the world, was permitted now to separate himself from him!

3148
05:44:58,980 --> 05:45:07,940
He began to accuse and abuse himself, and, as if he were director of police, administered to himself a sound lecture for his greenness.

3149
05:45:08,480 --> 05:45:09,800
"I have been an idiot!"

3150
05:45:09,980 --> 05:45:12,160
he thought, "and this man will see it.

3151
05:45:12,520 --> 05:45:14,541
He has gone, and won't come back!

3152
05:45:15,140 --> 05:45:21,360
But how is it that I, Fix, who have in my pocket a warrant for his arrest, have been so fascinated by him?

3153
05:45:22,041 --> 05:45:24,580
Decidedly, I am nothing but an ass!"

3154
05:45:25,060 --> 05:45:29,180
So reasoned the detective, while the hours crept by all too slowly.

3155
05:45:30,080 --> 05:45:31,580
He did not know what to do.

3156
05:45:32,320 --> 05:45:39,560
Sometimes he was tempted to tell Aouda all; but he could not doubt how the young woman would receive his confidences.

3157
05:45:40,100 --> 05:45:41,440
What course should he take?

3158
05:45:41,898 --> 05:45:48,299
He thought of pursuing Fogg across the vast white plains; it did not seem impossible that he might overtake him.

3159
05:45:48,780 --> 05:45:51,139
Footsteps were easily printed on the snow!

3160
05:45:51,941 --> 05:45:55,781
But soon, under a new sheet, every imprint would be effaced.

3161
05:45:56,379 --> 05:45:57,820
Fix became discouraged.

3162
05:45:58,520 --> 05:46:02,640
He felt a sort of insurmountable longing to abandon the game altogether.

3163
05:46:03,340 --> 05:46:07,920
He could now leave Fort Kearney station, and pursue his journey homeward in peace.

3164
05:46:09,059 --> 05:46:16,000
Towards two o'clock in the afternoon, while it was snowing hard, long whistles were heard approaching from the east.

3165
05:46:16,800 --> 05:46:25,480
A great shadow, preceded by a wild light, slowly advanced, appearing still larger through the mist, which gave it a fantastic aspect.

3166
05:46:26,121 --> 05:46:38,260
No train was expected from the east, neither had there been time for the succour asked for by telegraph to arrive; the train from Omaha to San Francisco was not due till the next day.

3167
05:46:38,840 --> 05:46:40,600
The mystery was soon explained.

3168
05:46:41,180 --> 05:46:54,060
The locomotive, which was slowly approaching with deafening whistles, was that which, having been detached from the train, had continued its route with such terrific rapidity, carrying off the unconscious engineer and stoker.

3169
05:46:54,600 --> 05:47:06,240
It had run several miles, when, the fire becoming low for want of fuel, the steam had slackened; and it had finally stopped an hour after, some twenty miles beyond Fort Kearney.

3170
05:47:06,820 --> 05:47:14,940
Neither the engineer nor the stoker was dead, and, after remaining for some time in their swoon, had come to themselves.

3171
05:47:15,560 --> 05:47:17,300
The train had then stopped.

3172
05:47:17,639 --> 05:47:23,780
The engineer, when he found himself in the desert, and the locomotive without cars, understood what had happened.

3173
05:47:24,219 --> 05:47:32,760
He could not imagine how the locomotive had become separated from the train; but he did not doubt that the train left behind was in distress.

3174
05:47:33,280 --> 05:47:34,860
He did not hesitate what to do.

3175
05:47:35,360 --> 05:47:43,520
It would be prudent to continue on to Omaha, for it would be dangerous to return to the train, which the Indians might still be engaged in pillaging.

3176
05:47:44,340 --> 05:47:52,820
Nevertheless, he began to rebuild the fire in the furnace; the pressure again mounted, and the locomotive returned, running backwards to Fort Kearney.

3177
05:47:53,260 --> 05:47:55,800
This it was which was whistling in the mist.

3178
05:47:56,500 --> 05:48:00,959
The travellers were glad to see the locomotive resume its place at the head of the train.

3179
05:48:01,540 --> 05:48:04,719
They could now continue the journey so terribly interrupted.

3180
05:48:05,940 --> 05:48:11,780
Aouda, on seeing the locomotive come up, hurried out of the station, and asked the conductor, "Are you going to start?"

3181
05:48:12,160 --> 05:48:13,260
"At once, madam."

3182
05:48:13,700 --> 05:48:16,740
"But the prisoners, our unfortunate fellow-travellers--"

3183
05:48:17,200 --> 05:48:20,220
"I cannot interrupt the trip," replied the conductor.

3184
05:48:20,600 --> 05:48:22,920
"We are already three hours behind time."

3185
05:48:23,541 --> 05:48:26,541
"And when will another train pass here from San Francisco?"

3186
05:48:27,040 --> 05:48:28,180
"To-morrow evening, madam."

3187
05:48:28,720 --> 05:48:30,240
"To-morrow evening!

3188
05:48:30,300 --> 05:48:31,460
But then it will be too late!

3189
05:48:31,920 --> 05:48:32,980
We must wait--"

3190
05:48:33,420 --> 05:48:35,920
"It is impossible," responded the conductor.

3191
05:48:36,340 --> 05:48:38,140
"If you wish to go, please get in."

3192
05:48:38,680 --> 05:48:41,100
"I will not go," said Aouda.

3193
05:48:41,840 --> 05:48:43,420
Fix had heard this conversation.

3194
05:48:44,060 --> 05:48:59,680
A little while before, when there was no prospect of proceeding on the journey, he had made up his mind to leave Fort Kearney; but now that the train was there, ready to start, and he had only to take his seat in the car, an irresistible influence held him back.

3195
05:49:00,160 --> 05:49:03,060
The station platform burned his feet, and he could not stir.

3196
05:49:03,740 --> 05:49:08,300
The conflict in his mind again began; anger and failure stifled him.

3197
05:49:09,020 --> 05:49:10,880
He wished to struggle on to the end.

3198
05:49:11,900 --> 05:49:19,580
Meanwhile the passengers and some of the wounded, among them Colonel Proctor, whose injuries were serious, had taken their places in the train.

3199
05:49:20,420 --> 05:49:25,379
The buzzing of the over-heated boiler was heard, and the steam was escaping from the valves.

3200
05:49:25,740 --> 05:49:34,320
The engineer whistled, the train started, and soon disappeared, mingling its white smoke with the eddies of the densely falling snow.

3201
05:49:35,180 --> 05:49:37,320
The detective had remained behind.

3202
05:49:38,640 --> 05:49:39,860
Several hours passed.

3203
05:49:40,400 --> 05:49:43,160
The weather was dismal, and it was very cold.

3204
05:49:43,660 --> 05:49:47,860
Fix sat motionless on a bench in the station; he might have been thought asleep.

3205
05:49:48,680 --> 05:50:02,541
Aouda, despite the storm, kept coming out of the waiting-room, going to the end of the platform, and peering through the tempest of snow, as if to pierce the mist which narrowed the horizon around her, and to hear, if possible, some welcome sound.

3206
05:50:03,140 --> 05:50:04,500
She heard and saw nothing.

3207
05:50:04,860 --> 05:50:11,680
Then she would return, chilled through, to issue out again after the lapse of a few moments, but always in vain.

3208
05:50:13,060 --> 05:50:16,441
Evening came, and the little band had not returned.

3209
05:50:17,220 --> 05:50:18,260
Where could they be?

3210
05:50:18,800 --> 05:50:24,720
Had they found the Indians, and were they having a conflict with them, or were they still wandering amid the mist?

3211
05:50:25,720 --> 05:50:30,080
The commander of the fort was anxious, though he tried to conceal his apprehensions.

3212
05:50:30,900 --> 05:50:36,959
As night approached, the snow fell less plentifully, but it became intensely cold.

3213
05:50:36,980 --> 05:50:39,520
Absolute silence rested on the plains.

3214
05:50:40,080 --> 05:50:44,140
Neither flight of bird nor passing of beast troubled the perfect calm.

3215
05:50:45,781 --> 05:50:53,060
Throughout the night Aouda, full of sad forebodings, her heart stifled with anguish, wandered about on the verge of the plains.

3216
05:50:53,740 --> 05:50:58,520
Her imagination carried her far off, and showed her innumerable dangers.

3217
05:50:59,400 --> 05:51:03,559
What she suffered through the long hours it would be impossible to describe.

3218
05:51:04,559 --> 05:51:09,060
Fix remained stationary in the same place, but did not sleep.

3219
05:51:09,879 --> 05:51:15,280
Once a man approached and spoke to him, and the detective merely replied by shaking his head.

3220
05:51:16,060 --> 05:51:18,160
Thus the night passed.

3221
05:51:18,180 --> 05:51:27,201
At dawn, the half-extinguished disc of the sun rose above a misty horizon; but it was now possible to recognise objects two miles off.

3222
05:51:27,980 --> 05:51:34,820
Phileas Fogg and the squad had gone southward; in the south all was still vacancy.

3223
05:51:34,840 --> 05:51:36,420
It was then seven o'clock.

3224
05:51:37,140 --> 05:51:40,879
The captain, who was really alarmed, did not know what course to take.

3225
05:51:41,780 --> 05:51:44,660
Should he send another detachment to the rescue of the first?

3226
05:51:45,200 --> 05:51:50,600
Should he sacrifice more men, with so few chances of saving those already sacrificed?

3227
05:51:51,080 --> 05:51:53,361
His hesitation did not last long, however.

3228
05:51:54,080 --> 05:51:59,560
Calling one of his lieutenants, he was on the point of ordering a reconnaissance, when gunshots were heard.

3229
05:52:00,059 --> 05:52:00,780
Was it a signal?

3230
05:52:01,300 --> 05:52:06,940
The soldiers rushed out of the fort, and half a mile off they perceived a little band returning in good order.

3231
05:52:07,621 --> 05:52:15,640
Mr. Fogg was marching at their head, and just behind him were Passepartout and the other two travellers, rescued from the Sioux.

3232
05:52:16,260 --> 05:52:19,920
They had met and fought the Indians ten miles south of Fort Kearney.

3233
05:52:20,200 --> 05:52:32,500
Shortly before the detachment arrived, Passepartout and his companions had begun to struggle with their captors, three of whom the Frenchman had felled with his fists, when his master and the soldiers hastened up to their relief.

3234
05:52:33,200 --> 05:52:35,600
All were welcomed with joyful cries.

3235
05:52:36,240 --> 05:52:48,000
Phileas Fogg distributed the reward he had promised to the soldiers, while Passepartout, not without reason, muttered to himself, "It must certainly be confessed that I cost my master dear!"

3236
05:52:48,600 --> 05:52:55,900
Fix, without saying a word, looked at Mr. Fogg, and it would have been difficult to analyse the thoughts which struggled within him.

3237
05:52:56,559 --> 05:53:02,879
As for Aouda, she took her protector's hand and pressed it in her own, too much moved to speak.

3238
05:53:03,840 --> 05:53:13,400
Meanwhile, Passepartout was looking about for the train; he thought he should find it there, ready to start for Omaha, and he hoped that the time lost might be regained.

3239
05:53:13,959 --> 05:53:14,479
"The train!

3240
05:53:14,700 --> 05:53:15,299
the train!"

3241
05:53:15,621 --> 05:53:16,080
cried he.

3242
05:53:16,660 --> 05:53:18,201
"Gone," replied Fix.

3243
05:53:18,860 --> 05:53:20,959
"And when does the next train pass here?"

3244
05:53:21,380 --> 05:53:22,440
said Phileas Fogg.

3245
05:53:22,820 --> 05:53:24,041
"Not till this evening."

3246
05:53:24,880 --> 05:53:25,360
"Ah!"

3247
05:53:25,781 --> 05:53:27,880
returned the impassible gentleman quietly.

3248
05:53:28,710 --> 05:53:31,820

Around the World in Eighty Days

Translated by George Makepeace Towle

3253
05:53:53,031 --> 05:53:54,860
Chapter 31

3254
05:53:54,860 --> 05:54:01,090
IN WHICH FIX, THE DETECTIVE, CONSIDERABLY FURTHERS THE INTERESTS OF PHILEAS FOGG

3255
05:54:01,860 --> 05:54:04,959
Phileas Fogg found himself twenty hours behind time.

3256
05:54:05,600 --> 05:54:09,480
Passepartout, the involuntary cause of this delay, was desperate.

3257
05:54:10,059 --> 05:54:11,701
He had ruined his master!

3258
05:54:12,960 --> 05:54:17,800
At this moment the detective approached Mr. Fogg, and, looking him intently in the face, said:

3259
05:54:18,260 --> 05:54:20,879
"Seriously, sir, are you in great haste?"

3260
05:54:21,420 --> 05:54:22,541
"Quite seriously."

3261
05:54:23,080 --> 05:54:25,820
"I have a purpose in asking," resumed Fix.

3262
05:54:26,260 --> 05:54:35,000
"Is it absolutely necessary that you should be in New York on the 11th, before nine o'clock in the evening, the time that the steamer leaves for Liverpool?"

3263
05:54:35,940 --> 05:54:38,160
"It is absolutely necessary."

3264
05:54:38,800 --> 05:54:45,379
"And, if your journey had not been interrupted by these Indians, you would have reached New York on the morning of the 11th?"

3265
05:54:46,020 --> 05:54:49,440
"Yes; with eleven hours to spare before the steamer left."

3266
05:54:50,299 --> 05:54:50,640
"Good!

3267
05:54:51,020 --> 05:54:53,139
you are therefore twenty hours behind.

3268
05:54:53,780 --> 05:54:55,460
Twelve from twenty leaves eight.

3269
05:54:56,041 --> 05:54:57,920
You must regain eight hours.

3270
05:54:58,640 --> 05:55:00,100
Do you wish to try to do so?"

3271
05:55:01,480 --> 05:55:02,420
"On foot?"

3272
05:55:02,780 --> 05:55:03,541
asked Mr. Fogg.

3273
05:55:04,379 --> 05:55:07,020
"No; on a sledge," replied Fix.

3274
05:55:07,479 --> 05:55:09,240
"On a sledge with sails.

3275
05:55:09,720 --> 05:55:11,959
A man has proposed such a method to me."

3276
05:55:12,640 --> 05:55:17,719
It was the man who had spoken to Fix during the night, and whose offer he had refused.

3277
05:55:18,780 --> 05:55:28,240
Phileas Fogg did not reply at once; but Fix, having pointed out the man, who was walking up and down in front of the station, Mr. Fogg went up to him.

3278
05:55:29,160 --> 05:55:35,960
An instant after, Mr. Fogg and the American, whose name was Mudge, entered a hut built just below the fort.

3279
05:55:36,580 --> 05:55:49,920
There Mr. Fogg examined a curious vehicle, a kind of frame on two long beams, a little raised in front like the runners of a sledge, and upon which there was room for five or six persons.

3280
05:55:50,639 --> 05:55:58,420
A high mast was fixed on the frame, held firmly by metallic lashings, to which was attached a large brigantine sail.

3281
05:55:59,041 --> 05:56:03,121
This mast held an iron stay upon which to hoist a jib-sail.

3282
05:56:03,760 --> 05:56:06,680
Behind, a sort of rudder served to guide the vehicle.

3283
05:56:07,420 --> 05:56:10,260
It was, in short, a sledge rigged like a sloop.

3284
05:56:11,560 --> 05:56:21,100
During the winter, when the trains are blocked up by the snow, these sledges make extremely rapid journeys across the frozen plains from one station to another.

3285
05:56:22,140 --> 05:56:32,820
Provided with more sails than a cutter, and with the wind behind them, they slip over the surface of the prairies with a speed equal if not superior to that of the express trains.

3286
05:56:33,602 --> 05:56:37,041
Mr. Fogg readily made a bargain with the owner of this land-craft.

3287
05:56:37,041 --> 05:56:41,460
The wind was favourable, being fresh, and blowing from the west.

3288
05:56:41,940 --> 05:56:49,140
The snow had hardened, and Mudge was very confident of being able to transport Mr. Fogg in a few hours to Omaha.

3289
05:56:49,620 --> 05:56:53,621
Thence the trains eastward run frequently to Chicago and New York.

3290
05:56:54,459 --> 05:57:01,620
It was not impossible that the lost time might yet be recovered; and such an opportunity was not to be rejected.

3291
05:57:01,800 --> 05:57:18,060
Not wishing to expose Aouda to the discomforts of travelling in the open air, Mr. Fogg proposed to leave her with Passepartout at Fort Kearney, the servant taking upon himself to escort her to Europe by a better route and under more favourable conditions.

3292
05:57:18,580 --> 05:57:29,600
But Aouda refused to separate from Mr. Fogg, and Passepartout was delighted with her decision; for nothing could induce him to leave his master while Fix was with him.

3293
05:57:30,299 --> 05:57:33,600
It would be difficult to guess the detective's thoughts.

3294
05:57:34,280 --> 05:57:47,700
Was this conviction shaken by Phileas Fogg's return, or did he still regard him as an exceedingly shrewd rascal, who, his journey round the world completed, would think himself absolutely safe in England?

3295
05:57:48,640 --> 05:58:00,340
Perhaps Fix's opinion of Phileas Fogg was somewhat modified; but he was nevertheless resolved to do his duty, and to hasten the return of the whole party to England as much as possible.

3296
05:58:01,480 --> 05:58:04,360
At eight o'clock the sledge was ready to start.

3297
05:58:04,980 --> 05:58:10,240
The passengers took their places on it, and wrapped themselves up closely in their travelling-cloaks.

3298
05:58:10,861 --> 05:58:19,281
The two great sails were hoisted, and under the pressure of the wind the sledge slid over the hardened snow with a velocity of forty miles an hour.

3299
05:58:20,260 --> 05:58:26,500
The distance between Fort Kearney and Omaha, as the birds fly, is at most two hundred miles.

3300
05:58:27,041 --> 05:58:35,541
If the wind held good, the distance might be traversed in five hours; if no accident happened the sledge might reach Omaha by one o'clock.

3301
05:58:36,520 --> 05:58:37,360
What a journey!

3302
05:58:37,820 --> 05:58:45,080
The travellers, huddled close together, could not speak for the cold, intensified by the rapidity at which they were going.

3303
05:58:45,820 --> 05:58:49,020
The sledge sped on as lightly as a boat over the waves.

3304
05:58:49,500 --> 05:58:54,640
When the breeze came skimming the earth the sledge seemed to be lifted off the ground by its sails.

3305
05:58:55,480 --> 05:59:03,400
Mudge, who was at the rudder, kept in a straight line, and by a turn of his hand checked the lurches which the vehicle had a tendency to make.

3306
05:59:04,100 --> 05:59:09,879
All the sails were up, and the jib was so arranged as not to screen the brigantine.

3307
05:59:09,900 --> 05:59:16,340
A top-mast was hoisted, and another jib, held out to the wind, added its force to the other sails.

3308
05:59:16,920 --> 05:59:23,900
Although the speed could not be exactly estimated, the sledge could not be going at less than forty miles an hour.

3309
05:59:24,460 --> 05:59:27,760
"If nothing breaks," said Mudge, "we shall get there!"

3310
05:59:28,540 --> 05:59:36,299
Mr. Fogg had made it for Mudge's interest to reach Omaha within the time agreed on, by the offer of a handsome reward.

3311
05:59:37,240 --> 05:59:42,600
The prairie, across which the sledge was moving in a straight line, was as flat as a sea.

3312
05:59:43,320 --> 05:59:45,820
It seemed like a vast frozen lake.

3313
05:59:46,380 --> 05:59:58,340
The railroad which ran through this section ascended from the south-west to the north-west by Great Island, Columbus, an important Nebraska town, Schuyler, and Fremont, to Omaha.

3314
05:59:58,980 --> 06:00:01,740
It followed throughout the right bank of the Platte River.

3315
06:00:02,620 --> 06:00:07,720
The sledge, shortening this route, took a chord of the arc described by the railway.

3316
06:00:08,600 --> 06:00:13,219
Mudge was not afraid of being stopped by the Platte River, because it was frozen.

3317
06:00:13,959 --> 06:00:24,340
The road, then, was quite clear of obstacles, and Phileas Fogg had but two things to fear--an accident to the sledge, and a change or calm in the wind.

3318
06:00:25,320 --> 06:00:33,300
But the breeze, far from lessening its force, blew as if to bend the mast, which, however, the metallic lashings held firmly.

3319
06:00:33,799 --> 06:00:40,182
These lashings, like the chords of a stringed instrument, resounded as if vibrated by a violin bow.

3320
06:00:40,780 --> 06:00:44,959
The sledge slid along in the midst of a plaintively intense melody.

3321
06:00:45,500 --> 06:00:49,560
"Those chords give the fifth and the octave," said Mr. Fogg.

3322
06:00:50,160 --> 06:00:52,719
These were the only words he uttered during the journey.

3323
06:00:53,420 --> 06:01:00,460
Aouda, cosily packed in furs and cloaks, was sheltered as much as possible from the attacks of the freezing wind.

3324
06:01:01,201 --> 06:01:10,060
As for Passepartout, his face was as red as the sun's disc when it sets in the mist, and he laboriously inhaled the biting air.

3325
06:01:10,740 --> 06:01:14,479
With his natural buoyancy of spirits, he began to hope again.

3326
06:01:15,219 --> 06:01:24,940
They would reach New York on the evening, if not on the morning, of the 11th, and there was still some chances that it would be before the steamer sailed for Liverpool.

3327
06:01:25,980 --> 06:01:30,780
Passepartout even felt a strong desire to grasp his ally, Fix, by the hand.

3328
06:01:31,460 --> 06:01:42,520
He remembered that it was the detective who procured the sledge, the only means of reaching Omaha in time; but, checked by some presentiment, he kept his usual reserve.

3329
06:01:43,559 --> 06:01:52,780
One thing, however, Passepartout would never forget, and that was the sacrifice which Mr. Fogg had made, without hesitation, to rescue him from the Sioux.

3330
06:01:53,500 --> 06:01:56,300
Mr. Fogg had risked his fortune and his life.

3331
06:01:56,880 --> 06:01:57,300
No!

3332
06:01:57,379 --> 06:01:59,639
His servant would never forget that!

3333
06:02:00,760 --> 06:02:07,640
While each of the party was absorbed in reflections so different, the sledge flew past over the vast carpet of snow.

3334
06:02:08,180 --> 06:02:10,640
The creeks it passed over were not perceived.

3335
06:02:11,180 --> 06:02:14,920
Fields and streams disappeared under the uniform whiteness.

3336
06:02:15,200 --> 06:02:17,299
The plain was absolutely deserted.

3337
06:02:18,281 --> 06:02:25,480
Between the Union Pacific road and the branch which unites Kearney with Saint Joseph it formed a great uninhabited island.

3338
06:02:25,920 --> 06:02:28,420
Neither village, station, nor fort appeared.

3339
06:02:29,080 --> 06:02:35,760
From time to time they sped by some phantom-like tree, whose white skeleton twisted and rattled in the wind.

3340
06:02:36,660 --> 06:02:44,860
Sometimes flocks of wild birds rose, or bands of gaunt, famished, ferocious prairie-wolves ran howling after the sledge.

3341
06:02:45,540 --> 06:02:50,640
Passepartout, revolver in hand, held himself ready to fire on those which came too near.

3342
06:02:51,240 --> 06:03:06,120
Had an accident then happened to the sledge, the travellers, attacked by these beasts, would have been in the most terrible danger; but it held on its even course, soon gained on the wolves, and ere long left the howling band at a safe distance behind.

3343
06:03:07,440 --> 06:03:12,560
About noon Mudge perceived by certain landmarks that he was crossing the Platte River.

3344
06:03:13,220 --> 06:03:18,200
He said nothing, but he felt certain that he was now within twenty miles of Omaha.

3345
06:03:18,680 --> 06:03:30,602
In less than an hour he left the rudder and furled his sails, whilst the sledge, carried forward by the great impetus the wind had given it, went on half a mile further with its sails unspread.

3346
06:03:31,480 --> 06:03:38,299
It stopped at last, and Mudge, pointing to a mass of roofs white with snow, said: "We have got there!"

3347
06:03:38,820 --> 06:03:39,580
Arrived!

3348
06:03:39,700 --> 06:03:46,440
Arrived at the station which is in daily communication, by numerous trains, with the Atlantic seaboard!

3349
06:03:46,960 --> 06:03:54,959
Passepartout and Fix jumped off, stretched their stiffened limbs, and aided Mr. Fogg and the young woman to descend from the sledge.

3350
06:03:55,600 --> 06:04:05,120
Phileas Fogg generously rewarded Mudge, whose hand Passepartout warmly grasped, and the party directed their steps to the Omaha railway station.

3351
06:04:05,960 --> 06:04:11,020
The Pacific Railroad proper finds its terminus at this important Nebraska town.

3352
06:04:11,880 --> 06:04:20,160
Omaha is connected with Chicago by the Chicago and Rock Island Railroad, which runs directly east, and passes fifty stations.

3353
06:04:21,140 --> 06:04:28,180
A train was ready to start when Mr. Fogg and his party reached the station, and they only had time to get into the cars.

3354
06:04:28,760 --> 06:04:38,041
They had seen nothing of Omaha; but Passepartout confessed to himself that this was not to be regretted, as they were not travelling to see the sights.

3355
06:04:38,840 --> 06:04:45,121
The train passed rapidly across the State of Iowa, by Council Bluffs, Des Moines, and Iowa City.

3356
06:04:45,941 --> 06:04:51,680
During the night it crossed the Mississippi at Davenport, and by Rock Island entered Illinois.

3357
06:04:52,521 --> 06:05:04,799
The next day, which was the 10th, at four o'clock in the evening, it reached Chicago, already risen from its ruins, and more proudly seated than ever on the borders of its beautiful Lake Michigan.

3358
06:05:05,920 --> 06:05:11,940
Nine hundred miles separated Chicago from New York; but trains are not wanting at Chicago.

3359
06:05:12,559 --> 06:05:25,660
Mr. Fogg passed at once from one to the other, and the locomotive of the Pittsburgh, Fort Wayne, and Chicago Railway left at full speed, as if it fully comprehended that that gentleman had no time to lose.

3360
06:05:26,260 --> 06:05:39,640
It traversed Indiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, and New Jersey like a flash, rushing through towns with antique names, some of which had streets and car-tracks, but as yet no houses.

3361
06:05:39,660 --> 06:05:51,861
At last the Hudson came into view; and, at a quarter-past eleven in the evening of the 11th, the train stopped in the station on the right bank of the river, before the very pier of the Cunard line.

3362
06:05:53,020 --> 06:05:58,020
The China, for Liverpool, had started three-quarters of an hour before!

3363

Chapter 32

3369
06:06:24,950 --> 06:06:30,621
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG ENGAGES IN A DIRECT STRUGGLE WITH BAD FORTUNE

3370
06:06:31,320 --> 06:06:35,740
The China, in leaving, seemed to have carried off Phileas Fogg's last hope.

3371
06:06:36,440 --> 06:06:39,680
None of the other steamers were able to serve his projects.

3372
06:06:40,360 --> 06:07:01,140
The Pereire, of the French Transatlantic Company, whose admirable steamers are equal to any in speed and comfort, did not leave until the 14th; the Hamburg boats did not go directly to Liverpool or London, but to Havre; and the additional trip from Havre to Southampton would render Phileas Fogg's last efforts of no avail.

3373
06:07:02,240 --> 06:07:08,860
The Inman steamer did not depart till the next day, and could not cross the Atlantic in time to save the wager.

3374
06:07:09,800 --> 06:07:16,660
Mr. Fogg learned all this in consulting his Bradshaw, which gave him the daily movements of the trans-Atlantic steamers.

3375
06:07:17,680 --> 06:07:23,621
Passepartout was crushed; it overwhelmed him to lose the boat by three-quarters of an hour.

3376
06:07:24,201 --> 06:07:30,300
It was his fault, for, instead of helping his master, he had not ceased putting obstacles in his path!

3377
06:07:30,700 --> 06:07:49,960
And when he recalled all the incidents of the tour, when he counted up the sums expended in pure loss and on his own account, when he thought that the immense stake, added to the heavy charges of this useless journey, would completely ruin Mr. Fogg, he overwhelmed himself with bitter self-accusations.

3378
06:07:51,020 --> 06:07:59,420
Mr. Fogg, however, did not reproach him; and, on leaving the Cunard pier, only said: "We will consult about what is best to-morrow.

3379
06:07:59,420 --> 06:08:00,080
Come."

3380
06:08:01,340 --> 06:08:06,980
The party crossed the Hudson in the Jersey City ferryboat, and drove in a carriage to the St.

3381
06:08:07,140 --> 06:08:08,820
Nicholas Hotel, on Broadway.

3382
06:08:09,580 --> 06:08:21,140
Rooms were engaged, and the night passed, briefly to Phileas Fogg, who slept profoundly, but very long to Aouda and the others, whose agitation did not permit them to rest.

3383
06:08:22,100 --> 06:08:24,299
The next day was the 12th of December.

3384
06:08:24,980 --> 06:08:34,480
From seven in the morning of the 12th to a quarter before nine in the evening of the 21st there were nine days, thirteen hours, and forty-five minutes.

3385
06:08:35,420 --> 06:08:44,959
If Phileas Fogg had left in the China, one of the fastest steamers on the Atlantic, he would have reached Liverpool, and then London, within the period agreed upon.

3386
06:08:46,160 --> 06:08:54,980
Mr. Fogg left the hotel alone, after giving Passepartout instructions to await his return, and inform Aouda to be ready at an instant's notice.

3387
06:08:55,818 --> 06:09:03,980
He proceeded to the banks of the Hudson, and looked about among the vessels moored or anchored in the river, for any that were about to depart.

3388
06:09:04,760 --> 06:09:17,360
Several had departure signals, and were preparing to put to sea at morning tide; for in this immense and admirable port there is not one day in a hundred that vessels do not set out for every quarter of the globe.

3389
06:09:18,420 --> 06:09:23,620
But they were mostly sailing vessels, of which, of course, Phileas Fogg could make no use.

3390
06:09:24,760 --> 06:09:39,620
He seemed about to give up all hope, when he espied, anchored at the Battery, a cable's length off at most, a trading vessel, with a screw, well-shaped, whose funnel, puffing a cloud of smoke, indicated that she was getting ready for departure.

3391
06:09:40,160 --> 06:09:47,080
Phileas Fogg hailed a boat, got into it, and soon found himself on board the Henrietta, iron-hulled, wood-built above.

3392
06:09:47,920 --> 06:09:53,220
He ascended to the deck, and asked for the captain, who forthwith presented himself.

3393
06:09:53,760 --> 06:10:04,000
He was a man of fifty, a sort of sea-wolf, with big eyes, a complexion of oxidised copper, red hair and thick neck, and a growling voice.

3394
06:10:04,820 --> 06:10:05,440
"The captain?"

3395
06:10:05,920 --> 06:10:06,620
asked Mr. Fogg.

3396
06:10:07,100 --> 06:10:08,180
"I am the captain."

3397
06:10:09,059 --> 06:10:11,060
"I am Phileas Fogg, of London."

3398
06:10:11,781 --> 06:10:14,540
"And I am Andrew Speedy, of Cardiff."

3399
06:10:15,100 --> 06:10:16,780
"You are going to put to sea?"

3400
06:10:17,440 --> 06:10:18,320
"In an hour."

3401
06:10:18,920 --> 06:10:19,900
"You are bound for--"

3402
06:10:20,460 --> 06:10:21,021
"Bordeaux."

3403
06:10:21,740 --> 06:10:22,480
"And your cargo?"

3404
06:10:23,080 --> 06:10:24,041
"No freight.

3405
06:10:24,059 --> 06:10:25,041
Going in ballast."

3406
06:10:25,720 --> 06:10:26,979
"Have you any passengers?"

3407
06:10:27,660 --> 06:10:28,860
"No passengers.

3408
06:10:29,080 --> 06:10:30,360
Never have passengers.

3409
06:10:30,540 --> 06:10:31,559
Too much in the way."

3410
06:10:32,260 --> 06:10:33,740
"Is your vessel a swift one?"

3411
06:10:34,680 --> 06:10:36,900
"Between eleven and twelve knots.

3412
06:10:37,281 --> 06:10:39,020
The Henrietta, well known."

3413
06:10:39,780 --> 06:10:42,920
"Will you carry me and three other persons to Liverpool?"

3414
06:10:43,521 --> 06:10:44,500
"To Liverpool?

3415
06:10:44,781 --> 06:10:46,060
Why not to China?"

3416
06:10:46,600 --> 06:10:47,940
"I said Liverpool."

3417
06:10:48,400 --> 06:10:49,160
"No!"

3418
06:10:49,940 --> 06:10:50,260
"No?"

3419
06:10:50,880 --> 06:10:51,400
"No.

3420
06:10:51,440 --> 06:10:54,879
I am setting out for Bordeaux, and shall go to Bordeaux."

3421
06:10:55,879 --> 06:10:57,121
"Money is no object?"

3422
06:10:57,740 --> 06:10:58,280
"None."

3423
06:10:58,300 --> 06:11:02,880
The captain spoke in a tone which did not admit of a reply.

3424
06:11:03,720 --> 06:11:07,080
"But the owners of the Henrietta--" resumed Phileas Fogg.

3425
06:11:07,880 --> 06:11:11,121
"The owners are myself," replied the captain.

3426
06:11:11,720 --> 06:11:13,580
"The vessel belongs to me."

3427
06:11:14,602 --> 06:11:16,000
"I will freight it for you."

3428
06:11:16,840 --> 06:11:17,521
"No."

3429
06:11:18,459 --> 06:11:19,740
"I will buy it of you."

3430
06:11:20,220 --> 06:11:20,900
"No."

3431
06:11:22,040 --> 06:11:27,300
Phileas Fogg did not betray the least disappointment; but the situation was a grave one.

3432
06:11:28,100 --> 06:11:35,200
It was not at New York as at Hong Kong, nor with the captain of the Henrietta as with the captain of the Tankadere.

3433
06:11:36,140 --> 06:11:39,479
Up to this time money had smoothed away every obstacle.

3434
06:11:40,360 --> 06:11:41,840
Now money failed.

3435
06:11:43,201 --> 06:11:55,180
Still, some means must be found to cross the Atlantic on a boat, unless by balloon--which would have been venturesome, besides not being capable of being put in practice.

3436
06:11:56,140 --> 06:12:03,200
It seemed that Phileas Fogg had an idea, for he said to the captain, "Well, will you carry me to Bordeaux?"

3437
06:12:03,799 --> 06:12:06,920
"No, not if you paid me two hundred dollars."

3438
06:12:07,818 --> 06:12:09,700
"I offer you two thousand."

3439
06:12:10,440 --> 06:12:11,219
"Apiece?"

3440
06:12:11,880 --> 06:12:12,520
"Apiece."

3441
06:12:13,398 --> 06:12:15,440
"And there are four of you?"

3442
06:12:16,380 --> 06:12:16,780
"Four."

3443
06:12:17,740 --> 06:12:19,719
Captain Speedy began to scratch his head.

3444
06:12:20,440 --> 06:12:29,740
There were eight thousand dollars to gain, without changing his route; for which it was well worth conquering the repugnance he had for all kinds of passengers.

3445
06:12:30,500 --> 06:12:36,260
Besides, passengers at two thousand dollars are no longer passengers, but valuable merchandise.

3446
06:12:37,041 --> 06:12:41,020
"I start at nine o'clock," said Captain Speedy, simply.

3447
06:12:41,820 --> 06:12:43,520
"Are you and your party ready?"

3448
06:12:44,920 --> 06:12:49,879
"We will be on board at nine o'clock," replied, no less simply, Mr. Fogg.

3449
06:12:51,160 --> 06:12:52,300
It was half-past eight.

3450
06:12:52,820 --> 06:12:56,720
To disembark from the Henrietta, jump into a hack, hurry to the St.

3451
06:12:56,800 --> 06:13:08,560
Nicholas, and return with Aouda, Passepartout, and even the inseparable Fix was the work of a brief time, and was performed by Mr. Fogg with the coolness which never abandoned him.

3452
06:13:09,400 --> 06:13:12,559
They were on board when the Henrietta made ready to weigh anchor.

3453
06:13:13,200 --> 06:13:22,300
When Passepartout heard what this last voyage was going to cost, he uttered a prolonged "Oh!"

3454
06:13:22,602 --> 06:13:25,379
which extended throughout his vocal gamut.

3455
06:13:26,060 --> 06:13:33,219
As for Fix, he said to himself that the Bank of England would certainly not come out of this affair well indemnified.

3456
06:13:33,820 --> 06:13:43,220
When they reached England, even if Mr. Fogg did not throw some handfuls of bank-bills into the sea, more than seven thousand pounds would have been spent!

Chapter 33

3463
06:14:09,770 --> 06:14:14,059
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG SHOWS HIMSELF EQUAL TO THE OCCASION

3464
06:14:14,660 --> 06:14:22,620
An hour after, the Henrietta passed the lighthouse which marks the entrance of the Hudson, turned the point of Sandy Hook, and put to sea.

3465
06:14:23,420 --> 06:14:29,701
During the day she skirted Long Island, passed Fire Island, and directed her course rapidly eastward.

3466
06:14:30,820 --> 06:14:35,160
At noon the next day, a man mounted the bridge to ascertain the vessel's position.

3467
06:14:35,720 --> 06:14:38,139
It might be thought that this was Captain Speedy.

3468
06:14:38,680 --> 06:14:40,460
Not the least in the world.

3469
06:14:40,480 --> 06:14:42,700
It was Phileas Fogg, Esquire.

3470
06:14:43,740 --> 06:14:53,219
As for Captain Speedy, he was shut up in his cabin under lock and key, and was uttering loud cries, which signified an anger at once pardonable and excessive.

3471
06:14:54,000 --> 06:14:55,540
What had happened was very simple.

3472
06:14:56,139 --> 06:15:00,898
Phileas Fogg wished to go to Liverpool, but the captain would not carry him there.

3473
06:15:01,760 --> 06:15:19,060
Then Phileas Fogg had taken passage for Bordeaux, and, during the thirty hours he had been on board, had so shrewdly managed with his banknotes that the sailors and stokers, who were only an occasional crew, and were not on the best terms with the captain, went over to him in a body.

3474
06:15:19,740 --> 06:15:31,220
This was why Phileas Fogg was in command instead of Captain Speedy; why the captain was a prisoner in his cabin; and why, in short, the Henrietta was directing her course towards Liverpool.

3475
06:15:31,979 --> 06:15:36,559
It was very clear, to see Mr. Fogg manage the craft, that he had been a sailor.

3476
06:15:37,600 --> 06:15:40,299
How the adventure ended will be seen anon.

3477
06:15:41,180 --> 06:15:43,740
Aouda was anxious, though she said nothing.

3478
06:15:44,400 --> 06:15:48,639
As for Passepartout, he thought Mr. Fogg's manoeuvre simply glorious.

3479
06:15:49,400 --> 06:15:54,720
The captain had said "between eleven and twelve knots," and the Henrietta confirmed his prediction.

3480
06:15:55,640 --> 06:16:16,240
If, then--for there were "ifs" still--the sea did not become too boisterous, if the wind did not veer round to the east, if no accident happened to the boat or its machinery, the Henrietta might cross the three thousand miles from New York to Liverpool in the nine days, between the 12th and the 21st of December.

3481
06:16:17,059 --> 06:16:28,000
It is true that, once arrived, the affair on board the Henrietta, added to that of the Bank of England, might create more difficulties for Mr. Fogg than he imagined or could desire.

3482
06:16:29,420 --> 06:16:32,260
During the first days, they went along smoothly enough.

3483
06:16:32,560 --> 06:16:43,920
The sea was not very unpropitious, the wind seemed stationary in the north-east, the sails were hoisted, and the Henrietta ploughed across the waves like a real trans-Atlantic steamer.

3484
06:16:44,660 --> 06:16:46,280
Passepartout was delighted.

3485
06:16:46,800 --> 06:16:51,781
His master's last exploit, the consequences of which he ignored, enchanted him.

3486
06:16:52,420 --> 06:16:55,520
Never had the crew seen so jolly and dexterous a fellow.

3487
06:16:56,220 --> 06:17:01,219
He formed warm friendships with the sailors, and amazed them with his acrobatic feats.

3488
06:17:01,780 --> 06:17:06,861
He thought they managed the vessel like gentlemen, and that the stokers fired up like heroes.

3489
06:17:07,459 --> 06:17:10,140
His loquacious good-humour infected everyone.

3490
06:17:10,800 --> 06:17:14,140
He had forgotten the past, its vexations and delays.

3491
06:17:14,541 --> 06:17:23,459
He only thought of the end, so nearly accomplished; and sometimes he boiled over with impatience, as if heated by the furnaces of the Henrietta.

3492
06:17:24,379 --> 06:17:34,879
Often, also, the worthy fellow revolved around Fix, looking at him with a keen, distrustful eye; but he did not speak to him, for their old intimacy no longer existed.

3493
06:17:36,520 --> 06:17:40,379
Fix, it must be confessed, understood nothing of what was going on.

3494
06:17:40,940 --> 06:17:50,040
The conquest of the Henrietta, the bribery of the crew, Fogg managing the boat like a skilled seaman, amazed and confused him.

3495
06:17:50,080 --> 06:17:51,220
He did not know what to think.

3496
06:17:51,660 --> 06:18:12,820
For, after all, a man who began by stealing fifty-five thousand pounds might end by stealing a vessel; and Fix was not unnaturally inclined to conclude that the Henrietta under Fogg's command, was not going to Liverpool at all, but to some part of the world where the robber, turned into a pirate, would quietly put himself in safety.

3497
06:18:13,719 --> 06:18:20,980
The conjecture was at least a plausible one, and the detective began to seriously regret that he had embarked on the affair.

3498
06:18:22,280 --> 06:18:34,299
As for Captain Speedy, he continued to howl and growl in his cabin; and Passepartout, whose duty it was to carry him his meals, courageous as he was, took the greatest precautions.

3499
06:18:34,980 --> 06:18:38,660
Mr. Fogg did not seem even to know that there was a captain on board.

3500
06:18:39,900 --> 06:18:49,840
On the 13th they passed the edge of the Banks of Newfoundland, a dangerous locality; during the winter, especially, there are frequent fogs and heavy gales of wind.

3501
06:18:50,660 --> 06:19:03,818
Ever since the evening before the barometer, suddenly falling, had indicated an approaching change in the atmosphere; and during the night the temperature varied, the cold became sharper, and the wind veered to the south-east.

3502
06:19:04,361 --> 06:19:05,559
This was a misfortune.

3503
06:19:06,102 --> 06:19:19,760
Mr. Fogg, in order not to deviate from his course, furled his sails and increased the force of the steam; but the vessel's speed slackened, owing to the state of the sea, the long waves of which broke against the stern.

3504
06:19:20,400 --> 06:19:24,021
She pitched violently, and this retarded her progress.

3505
06:19:24,541 --> 06:19:33,041
The breeze little by little swelled into a tempest, and it was to be feared that the Henrietta might not be able to maintain herself upright on the waves.

3506
06:19:33,621 --> 06:19:40,340
Passepartout's visage darkened with the skies, and for two days the poor fellow experienced constant fright.

3507
06:19:41,021 --> 06:19:50,820
But Phileas Fogg was a bold mariner, and knew how to maintain headway against the sea; and he kept on his course, without even decreasing his steam.

3508
06:19:51,541 --> 06:19:58,100
The Henrietta, when she could not rise upon the waves, crossed them, swamping her deck, but passing safely.

3509
06:19:58,820 --> 06:20:08,639
Sometimes the screw rose out of the water, beating its protruding end, when a mountain of water raised the stern above the waves; but the craft always kept straight ahead.

3510
06:20:08,780 --> 06:20:19,920
The wind, however, did not grow as boisterous as might have been feared; it was not one of those tempests which burst, and rush on with a speed of ninety miles an hour.

3511
06:20:19,940 --> 06:20:27,120
It continued fresh, but, unhappily, it remained obstinately in the south-east, rendering the sails useless.

3512
06:20:28,180 --> 06:20:37,240
The 16th of December was the seventy-fifth day since Phileas Fogg's departure from London, and the Henrietta had not yet been seriously delayed.

3513
06:20:37,940 --> 06:20:42,740
Half of the voyage was almost accomplished, and the worst localities had been passed.

3514
06:20:43,420 --> 06:20:47,060
In summer, success would have been well-nigh certain.

3515
06:20:47,080 --> 06:20:49,720
In winter, they were at the mercy of the bad season.

3516
06:20:50,560 --> 06:21:01,021
Passepartout said nothing; but he cherished hope in secret, and comforted himself with the reflection that, if the wind failed them, they might still count on the steam.

3517
06:21:02,460 --> 06:21:07,820
On this day the engineer came on deck, went up to Mr. Fogg, and began to speak earnestly with him.

3518
06:21:08,580 --> 06:21:13,880
Without knowing why it was a presentiment, perhaps Passepartout became vaguely uneasy.

3519
06:21:14,541 --> 06:21:18,840
He would have given one of his ears to hear with the other what the engineer was saying.

3520
06:21:19,600 --> 06:21:26,120
He finally managed to catch a few words, and was sure he heard his master say, "You are certain of what you tell me?"

3521
06:21:26,639 --> 06:21:28,840
"Certain, sir," replied the engineer.

3522
06:21:29,440 --> 06:21:43,600
"You must remember that, since we started, we have kept up hot fires in all our furnaces, and, though we had coal enough to go on short steam from New York to Bordeaux, we haven't enough to go with all steam from New York to Liverpool."

3523
06:21:44,280 --> 06:21:46,700
"I will consider," replied Mr. Fogg.

3524
06:21:47,361 --> 06:21:51,460
Passepartout understood it all; he was seized with mortal anxiety.

3525
06:21:52,059 --> 06:21:53,660
The coal was giving out!

3526
06:21:54,000 --> 06:21:58,621
"Ah, if my master can get over that," muttered he, "he'll be a famous man!"

3527
06:21:59,260 --> 06:22:02,740
He could not help imparting to Fix what he had overheard.

3528
06:22:02,959 --> 06:22:05,760
"Then you believe that we really are going to Liverpool?"

3529
06:22:06,320 --> 06:22:06,980
"Of course."

3530
06:22:07,420 --> 06:22:07,941
"Ass!"

3531
06:22:08,220 --> 06:22:12,160
replied the detective, shrugging his shoulders and turning on his heel.

3532
06:22:12,200 --> 06:22:32,280
Passepartout was on the point of vigorously resenting the epithet, the reason of which he could not for the life of him comprehend; but he reflected that the unfortunate Fix was probably very much disappointed and humiliated in his self-esteem, after having so awkwardly followed a false scent around the world, and refrained.

3533
06:22:33,120 --> 06:22:35,420
And now what course would Phileas Fogg adopt?

3534
06:22:35,840 --> 06:22:37,340
It was difficult to imagine.

3535
06:22:38,060 --> 06:22:47,441
Nevertheless he seemed to have decided upon one, for that evening he sent for the engineer, and said to him, "Feed all the fires until the coal is exhausted."

3536
06:22:47,940 --> 06:22:52,479
A few moments after, the funnel of the Henrietta vomited forth torrents of smoke.

3537
06:22:52,600 --> 06:23:03,361
The vessel continued to proceed with all steam on; but on the 18th, the engineer, as he had predicted, announced that the coal would give out in the course of the day.

3538
06:23:04,400 --> 06:23:07,760
"Do not let the fires go down," replied Mr. Fogg.

3539
06:23:08,400 --> 06:23:09,720
"Keep them up to the last.

3540
06:23:10,139 --> 06:23:11,620
Let the valves be filled."

3541
06:23:11,720 --> 06:23:20,182
Towards noon Phileas Fogg, having ascertained their position, called Passepartout, and ordered him to go for Captain Speedy.

3542
06:23:20,840 --> 06:23:24,660
It was as if the honest fellow had been commanded to unchain a tiger.

3543
06:23:25,560 --> 06:23:29,560
He went to the poop, saying to himself, "He will be like a madman!"

3544
06:23:30,660 --> 06:23:34,840
In a few moments, with cries and oaths, a bomb appeared on the poop-deck.

3545
06:23:35,580 --> 06:23:37,200
The bomb was Captain Speedy.

3546
06:23:37,740 --> 06:23:40,320
It was clear that he was on the point of bursting.

3547
06:23:41,240 --> 06:23:42,380
"Where are we?"

3548
06:23:42,660 --> 06:23:45,660
were the first words his anger permitted him to utter.

3549
06:23:45,720 --> 06:23:50,960
Had the poor man been an apoplectic, he could never have recovered from his paroxysm of wrath.

3550
06:23:51,600 --> 06:23:52,459
"Where are we?"

3551
06:23:52,840 --> 06:23:54,460
he repeated, with purple face.

3552
06:23:55,281 --> 06:24:01,459
"Seven hundred and seven miles from Liverpool," replied Mr. Fogg, with imperturbable calmness.

3553
06:24:02,100 --> 06:24:02,940
"Pirate!"

3554
06:24:03,220 --> 06:24:04,459
cried Captain Speedy.

3555
06:24:05,340 --> 06:24:06,860
"I have sent for you, sir--"

3556
06:24:07,361 --> 06:24:08,340
"Pickaroon!"

3557
06:24:09,200 --> 06:24:13,398
"--sir," continued Mr. Fogg, "to ask you to sell me your vessel."

3558
06:24:13,980 --> 06:24:14,600
"No!

3559
06:24:14,660 --> 06:24:16,900
By all the devils, no!"

3560
06:24:17,799 --> 06:24:19,880
"But I shall be obliged to burn her."

3561
06:24:20,540 --> 06:24:22,100
"Burn the Henrietta!"

3562
06:24:23,100 --> 06:24:24,980
"Yes; at least the upper part of her.

3563
06:24:25,520 --> 06:24:26,740
The coal has given out."

3564
06:24:27,340 --> 06:24:29,000
"Burn my vessel!"

3565
06:24:29,460 --> 06:24:32,780
cried Captain Speedy, who could scarcely pronounce the words.

3566
06:24:33,160 --> 06:24:36,340
"A vessel worth fifty thousand dollars!"

3567
06:24:37,120 --> 06:24:42,840
"Here are sixty thousand," replied Phileas Fogg, handing the captain a roll of bank-bills.

3568
06:24:43,600 --> 06:24:46,480
This had a prodigious effect on Andrew Speedy.

3569
06:24:46,500 --> 06:24:51,580
An American can scarcely remain unmoved at the sight of sixty thousand dollars.

3570
06:24:52,280 --> 06:24:58,260
The captain forgot in an instant his anger, his imprisonment, and all his grudges against his passenger.

3571
06:24:58,980 --> 06:25:02,680
The Henrietta was twenty years old; it was a great bargain.

3572
06:25:03,360 --> 06:25:05,200
The bomb would not go off after all.

3573
06:25:05,700 --> 06:25:07,960
Mr. Fogg had taken away the match.

3574
06:25:08,620 --> 06:25:13,280
"And I shall still have the iron hull," said the captain in a softer tone.

3575
06:25:14,080 --> 06:25:15,820
"The iron hull and the engine.

3576
06:25:16,320 --> 06:25:16,980
Is it agreed?"

3577
06:25:17,580 --> 06:25:18,360
"Agreed."

3578
06:25:19,201 --> 06:25:23,781
And Andrew Speedy, seizing the banknotes, counted them and consigned them to his pocket.

3579
06:25:24,639 --> 06:25:32,440
During this colloquy, Passepartout was as white as a sheet, and Fix seemed on the point of having an apoplectic fit.

3580
06:25:33,460 --> 06:25:41,940
Nearly twenty thousand pounds had been expended, and Fogg left the hull and engine to the captain, that is, near the whole value of the craft!

3581
06:25:42,660 --> 06:25:47,281
It was true, however, that fifty-five thousand pounds had been stolen from the Bank.

3582
06:25:48,260 --> 06:25:54,140
When Andrew Speedy had pocketed the money, Mr. Fogg said to him, "Don't let this astonish you, sir.

3583
06:25:54,640 --> 06:26:03,460
You must know that I shall lose twenty thousand pounds, unless I arrive in London by a quarter before nine on the evening of the 21st of December.

3584
06:26:04,140 --> 06:26:08,600
I missed the steamer at New York, and as you refused to take me to Liverpool--"

3585
06:26:08,920 --> 06:26:10,340
"And I did well!"

3586
06:26:10,719 --> 06:26:15,220
cried Andrew Speedy; "for I have gained at least forty thousand dollars by it!"

3587
06:26:16,120 --> 06:26:19,520
He added, more sedately, "Do you know one thing, Captain--"

3588
06:26:20,120 --> 06:26:20,480
"Fogg."

3589
06:26:21,160 --> 06:26:25,121
"Captain Fogg, you've got something of the Yankee about you."

3590
06:26:25,799 --> 06:26:33,959
And, having paid his passenger what he considered a high compliment, he was going away, when Mr. Fogg said, "The vessel now belongs to me?"

3591
06:26:34,580 --> 06:26:39,300
"Certainly, from the keel to the truck of the masts--all the wood, that is."

3592
06:26:40,160 --> 06:26:40,760
"Very well.

3593
06:26:41,400 --> 06:26:45,340
Have the interior seats, bunks, and frames pulled down, and burn them."

3594
06:26:46,160 --> 06:26:56,100
It was necessary to have dry wood to keep the steam up to the adequate pressure, and on that day the poop, cabins, bunks, and the spare deck were sacrificed.

3595
06:26:56,121 --> 06:27:05,120
On the next day, the 19th of December, the masts, rafts, and spars were burned; the crew worked lustily, keeping up the fires.

3596
06:27:05,640 --> 06:27:08,940
Passepartout hewed, cut, and sawed away with all his might.

3597
06:27:09,500 --> 06:27:11,640
There was a perfect rage for demolition.

3598
06:27:12,360 --> 06:27:20,420
The railings, fittings, the greater part of the deck, and top sides disappeared on the 20th, and the Henrietta was now only a flat hulk.

3599
06:27:21,100 --> 06:27:25,300
But on this day they sighted the Irish coast and Fastnet Light.

3600
06:27:25,941 --> 06:27:28,620
By ten in the evening they were passing Queenstown.

3601
06:27:29,320 --> 06:27:38,500
Phileas Fogg had only twenty-four hours more in which to get to London; that length of time was necessary to reach Liverpool, with all steam on.

3602
06:27:39,020 --> 06:27:41,740
And the steam was about to give out altogether!

3603
06:27:42,560 --> 06:27:49,880
"Sir," said Captain Speedy, who was now deeply interested in Mr. Fogg's project, "I really commiserate you.

3604
06:27:50,420 --> 06:27:51,660
Everything is against you.

3605
06:27:52,120 --> 06:27:54,060
We are only opposite Queenstown."

3606
06:27:54,840 --> 06:27:59,720
"Ah," said Mr. Fogg, "is that place where we see the lights Queenstown?"

3607
06:28:00,280 --> 06:28:00,959
"Yes."

3608
06:28:01,660 --> 06:28:02,799
"Can we enter the harbour?"

3609
06:28:03,440 --> 06:28:04,980
"Not under three hours.

3610
06:28:05,160 --> 06:28:06,260
Only at high tide."

3611
06:28:07,080 --> 06:28:16,318
"Stay," replied Mr. Fogg calmly, without betraying in his features that by a supreme inspiration he was about to attempt once more to conquer ill-fortune.

3612
06:28:17,420 --> 06:28:22,680
Queenstown is the Irish port at which the trans-Atlantic steamers stop to put off the mails.

3613
06:28:23,240 --> 06:28:36,521
These mails are carried to Dublin by express trains always held in readiness to start; from Dublin they are sent on to Liverpool by the most rapid boats, and thus gain twelve hours on the Atlantic steamers.

3614
06:28:37,459 --> 06:28:40,980
Phileas Fogg counted on gaining twelve hours in the same way.

3615
06:28:41,660 --> 06:28:52,200
Instead of arriving at Liverpool the next evening by the Henrietta, he would be there by noon, and would therefore have time to reach London before a quarter before nine in the evening.

3616
06:28:53,360 --> 06:29:10,320
The Henrietta entered Queenstown Harbour at one o'clock in the morning, it then being high tide; and Phileas Fogg, after being grasped heartily by the hand by Captain Speedy, left that gentleman on the levelled hulk of his craft, which was still worth half what he had sold it for.

3617
06:29:11,299 --> 06:29:13,140
The party went on shore at once.

3618
06:29:13,440 --> 06:29:17,900
Fix was greatly tempted to arrest Mr. Fogg on the spot; but he did not.

3619
06:29:18,580 --> 06:29:18,920
Why?

3620
06:29:19,460 --> 06:29:22,121
What struggle was going on within him?

3621
06:29:22,140 --> 06:29:24,379
Had he changed his mind about "his man"?

3622
06:29:25,041 --> 06:29:27,340
Did he understand that he had made a grave mistake?

3623
06:29:28,160 --> 06:29:30,600
He did not, however, abandon Mr. Fogg.

3624
06:29:31,320 --> 06:29:46,281
They all got upon the train, which was just ready to start, at half-past one; at dawn of day they were in Dublin; and they lost no time in embarking on a steamer which, disdaining to rise upon the waves, invariably cut through them.

3625
06:29:47,361 --> 06:29:54,480
Phileas Fogg at last disembarked on the Liverpool quay, at twenty minutes before twelve, 21st December.

3626
06:29:55,140 --> 06:29:57,621
He was only six hours distant from London.

3627
06:29:58,900 --> 06:30:06,941
But at this moment Fix came up, put his hand upon Mr. Fogg's shoulder, and, showing his warrant, said, "You are really Phileas Fogg?"

3628
06:30:07,760 --> 06:30:08,280
"I am."

3629
06:30:09,100 --> 06:30:11,300
"I arrest you in the Queen's name!"

Chapter 34

3636
06:30:38,140 --> 06:30:41,960
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG AT LAST REACHES LONDON

3637
06:30:42,660 --> 06:30:44,120
Phileas Fogg was in prison.

3638
06:30:44,639 --> 06:30:49,400
He had been shut up in the Custom House, and he was to be transferred to London the next day.

3639
06:30:50,361 --> 06:30:57,840
Passepartout, when he saw his master arrested, would have fallen upon Fix had he not been held back by some policemen.

3640
06:30:57,861 --> 06:31:02,000
Aouda was thunderstruck at the suddenness of an event which she could not understand.

3641
06:31:02,820 --> 06:31:08,340
Passepartout explained to her how it was that the honest and courageous Fogg was arrested as a robber.

3642
06:31:08,879 --> 06:31:17,760
The young woman's heart revolted against so heinous a charge, and when she saw that she could attempt to do nothing to save her protector, she wept bitterly.

3643
06:31:18,840 --> 06:31:25,300
As for Fix, he had arrested Mr. Fogg because it was his duty, whether Mr. Fogg were guilty or not.

3644
06:31:26,280 --> 06:31:31,100
The thought then struck Passepartout, that he was the cause of this new misfortune!

3645
06:31:31,799 --> 06:31:34,600
Had he not concealed Fix's errand from his master?

3646
06:31:35,160 --> 06:31:40,420
When Fix revealed his true character and purpose, why had he not told Mr. Fogg?

3647
06:31:40,920 --> 06:31:57,360
If the latter had been warned, he would no doubt have given Fix proof of his innocence, and satisfied him of his mistake; at least, Fix would not have continued his journey at the expense and on the heels of his master, only to arrest him the moment he set foot on English soil.

3648
06:31:58,201 --> 06:32:03,080
Passepartout wept till he was blind, and felt like blowing his brains out.

3649
06:32:04,041 --> 06:32:08,840
Aouda and he had remained, despite the cold, under the portico of the Custom House.

3650
06:32:09,361 --> 06:32:13,780
Neither wished to leave the place; both were anxious to see Mr. Fogg again.

3651
06:32:14,520 --> 06:32:20,020
That gentleman was really ruined, and that at the moment when he was about to attain his end.

3652
06:32:20,860 --> 06:32:22,100
This arrest was fatal.

3653
06:32:22,100 --> 06:32:38,240
Having arrived at Liverpool at twenty minutes before twelve on the 21st of December, he had till a quarter before nine that evening to reach the Reform Club, that is, nine hours and a quarter; the journey from Liverpool to London was six hours.

3654
06:32:39,060 --> 06:32:49,320
If anyone, at this moment, had entered the Custom House, he would have found Mr. Fogg seated, motionless, calm, and without apparent anger, upon a wooden bench.

3655
06:32:49,760 --> 06:32:56,541
He was not, it is true, resigned; but this last blow failed to force him into an outward betrayal of any emotion.

3656
06:32:57,140 --> 06:33:07,200
Was he being devoured by one of those secret rages, all the more terrible because contained, and which only burst forth, with an irresistible force, at the last moment?

3657
06:33:07,781 --> 06:33:08,719
No one could tell.

3658
06:33:09,420 --> 06:33:12,000
There he sat, calmly waiting--for what?

3659
06:33:12,621 --> 06:33:13,860
Did he still cherish hope?

3660
06:33:14,379 --> 06:33:19,760
Did he still believe, now that the door of this prison was closed upon him, that he would succeed?

3661
06:33:20,420 --> 06:33:27,299
However that may have been, Mr. Fogg carefully put his watch upon the table, and observed its advancing hands.

3662
06:33:27,860 --> 06:33:33,201
Not a word escaped his lips, but his look was singularly set and stern.

3663
06:33:34,080 --> 06:33:44,441
The situation, in any event, was a terrible one, and might be thus stated: if Phileas Fogg was honest he was ruined; if he was a knave, he was caught.

3664
06:33:45,200 --> 06:33:46,400
Did escape occur to him?

3665
06:33:46,980 --> 06:33:51,560
Did he examine to see if there were any practicable outlet from his prison?

3666
06:33:52,180 --> 06:33:53,620
Did he think of escaping from it?

3667
06:33:54,300 --> 06:33:57,240
Possibly; for once he walked slowly around the room.

3668
06:33:58,060 --> 06:34:01,820
But the door was locked, and the window heavily barred with iron rods.

3669
06:34:02,299 --> 06:34:05,560
He sat down again, and drew his journal from his pocket.

3670
06:34:06,260 --> 06:34:16,920
On the line where these words were written, "21st December, Saturday, Liverpool," he added, "80th day, 11.40 a.m.," and waited.

3671
06:34:18,080 --> 06:34:19,980
The Custom House clock struck one.

3672
06:34:20,700 --> 06:34:24,620
Mr. Fogg observed that his watch was two hours too fast.

3673
06:34:25,360 --> 06:34:26,080
Two hours!

3674
06:34:26,580 --> 06:34:34,320
Admitting that he was at this moment taking an express train, he could reach London and the Reform Club by a quarter before nine, p.m.

3675
06:34:35,040 --> 06:34:36,680
His forehead slightly wrinkled.

3676
06:34:37,340 --> 06:34:44,500
At thirty-three minutes past two he heard a singular noise outside, then a hasty opening of doors.

3677
06:34:44,980 --> 06:34:49,260
Passepartout's voice was audible, and immediately after that of Fix.

3678
06:34:49,780 --> 06:34:52,360
Phileas Fogg's eyes brightened for an instant.

3679
06:34:53,180 --> 06:34:58,602
The door swung open, and he saw Passepartout, Aouda, and Fix, who hurried towards him.

3680
06:34:59,100 --> 06:35:01,600
Fix was out of breath, and his hair was in disorder.

3681
06:35:02,060 --> 06:35:02,860
He could not speak.

3682
06:35:03,340 --> 06:35:12,240
"Sir," he stammered, "sir--forgive me--most--unfortunate resemblance--robber arrested three days ago--you are free!"

3683
06:35:12,740 --> 06:35:14,140
Phileas Fogg was free!

3684
06:35:14,602 --> 06:35:28,100
He walked to the detective, looked him steadily in the face, and with the only rapid motion he had ever made in his life, or which he ever would make, drew back his arms, and with the precision of a machine knocked Fix down.

3685
06:35:28,660 --> 06:35:29,420
"Well hit!"

3686
06:35:29,720 --> 06:35:32,100
cried Passepartout, "Parbleu!

3687
06:35:32,140 --> 06:35:35,541
that's what you might call a good application of English fists!"

3688
06:35:35,940 --> 06:35:39,080
Fix, who found himself on the floor, did not utter a word.

3689
06:35:39,541 --> 06:35:41,380
He had only received his deserts.

3690
06:35:41,900 --> 06:35:50,320
Mr. Fogg, Aouda, and Passepartout left the Custom House without delay, got into a cab, and in a few moments descended at the station.

3691
06:35:51,060 --> 06:35:55,080
Phileas Fogg asked if there was an express train about to leave for London.

3692
06:35:55,660 --> 06:35:57,360
It was forty minutes past two.

3693
06:35:58,080 --> 06:36:00,780
The express train had left thirty-five minutes before.

3694
06:36:01,440 --> 06:36:03,740
Phileas Fogg then ordered a special train.

3695
06:36:04,300 --> 06:36:12,320
There were several rapid locomotives on hand; but the railway arrangements did not permit the special train to leave until three o'clock.

3696
06:36:13,139 --> 06:36:22,900
At that hour Phileas Fogg, having stimulated the engineer by the offer of a generous reward, at last set out towards London with Aouda and his faithful servant.

3697
06:36:23,379 --> 06:36:30,219
It was necessary to make the journey in five hours and a half; and this would have been easy on a clear road throughout.

3698
06:36:30,840 --> 06:36:40,100
But there were forced delays, and when Mr. Fogg stepped from the train at the terminus, all the clocks in London were striking ten minutes before nine.

3699
06:36:40,740 --> 06:36:44,900
Having made the tour of the world, he was behind-hand five minutes.

3700
06:36:45,320 --> 06:36:46,520
He had lost the wager!

3707
06:37:13,400 --> 06:37:19,172
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG DOES NOT HAVE TO REPEAT HIS ORDERS TO PASSEPARTOUT TWICE

3708
06:37:19,682 --> 06:37:26,500
The dwellers in Saville Row would have been surprised the next day, if they had been told that Phileas Fogg had returned home.

3709
06:37:27,200 --> 06:37:32,021
His doors and windows were still closed, no appearance of change was visible.

3710
06:37:32,640 --> 06:37:40,100
After leaving the station, Mr. Fogg gave Passepartout instructions to purchase some provisions, and quietly went to his domicile.

3711
06:37:40,701 --> 06:37:43,680
He bore his misfortune with his habitual tranquillity.

3712
06:37:44,580 --> 06:37:45,340
Ruined!

3713
06:37:45,361 --> 06:37:47,281
And by the blundering of the detective!

3714
06:37:48,060 --> 06:38:06,219
After having steadily traversed that long journey, overcome a hundred obstacles, braved many dangers, and still found time to do some good on his way, to fail near the goal by a sudden event which he could not have foreseen, and against which he was unarmed; it was terrible!

3715
06:38:07,320 --> 06:38:10,719
But a few pounds were left of the large sum he had carried with him.

3716
06:38:11,160 --> 06:38:19,500
There only remained of his fortune the twenty thousand pounds deposited at Barings, and this amount he owed to his friends of the Reform Club.

3717
06:38:20,360 --> 06:38:35,760
So great had been the expense of his tour that, even had he won, it would not have enriched him; and it is probable that he had not sought to enrich himself, being a man who rather laid wagers for honour's sake than for the stake proposed.

3718
06:38:36,480 --> 06:38:38,398
But this wager totally ruined him.

3719
06:38:39,121 --> 06:38:45,660
Mr. Fogg's course, however, was fully decided upon; he knew what remained for him to do.

3720
06:38:45,701 --> 06:38:53,300
A room in the house in Saville Row was set apart for Aouda, who was overwhelmed with grief at her protector's misfortune.

3721
06:38:54,000 --> 06:38:59,380
From the words which Mr. Fogg dropped, she saw that he was meditating some serious project.

3722
06:39:00,160 --> 06:39:13,799
Knowing that Englishmen governed by a fixed idea sometimes resort to the desperate expedient of suicide, Passepartout kept a narrow watch upon his master, though he carefully concealed the appearance of so doing.

3723
06:39:15,041 --> 06:39:22,080
First of all, the worthy fellow had gone up to his room, and had extinguished the gas burner, which had been burning for eighty days.

3724
06:39:22,120 --> 06:39:31,100
He had found in the letter-box a bill from the gas company, and he thought it more than time to put a stop to this expense, which he had been doomed to bear.

3725
06:39:32,140 --> 06:39:33,041
The night passed.

3726
06:39:33,420 --> 06:39:36,020
Mr. Fogg went to bed, but did he sleep?

3727
06:39:36,701 --> 06:39:38,880
Aouda did not once close her eyes.

3728
06:39:39,500 --> 06:39:43,900
Passepartout watched all night, like a faithful dog, at his master's door.

3729
06:39:44,920 --> 06:39:51,940
Mr. Fogg called him in the morning, and told him to get Aouda's breakfast, and a cup of tea and a chop for himself.

3730
06:39:52,600 --> 06:40:01,041
He desired Aouda to excuse him from breakfast and dinner, as his time would be absorbed all day in putting his affairs to rights.

3731
06:40:02,000 --> 06:40:06,340
In the evening he would ask permission to have a few moment's conversation with the young lady.

3732
06:40:06,880 --> 06:40:11,680
Passepartout, having received his orders, had nothing to do but obey them.

3733
06:40:11,700 --> 06:40:16,480
He looked at his imperturbable master, and could scarcely bring his mind to leave him.

3734
06:40:17,180 --> 06:40:28,000
His heart was full, and his conscience tortured by remorse; for he accused himself more bitterly than ever of being the cause of the irretrievable disaster.

3735
06:40:28,021 --> 06:40:28,600
Yes!

3736
06:40:28,720 --> 06:40:38,800
if he had warned Mr. Fogg, and had betrayed Fix's projects to him, his master would certainly not have given the detective passage to Liverpool, and then--

3737
06:40:39,299 --> 06:40:41,260
Passepartout could hold in no longer.

3738
06:40:41,860 --> 06:40:42,660
"My master!

3739
06:40:42,959 --> 06:40:43,800
Mr. Fogg!"

3740
06:40:44,120 --> 06:40:46,740
he cried, "why do you not curse me?

3741
06:40:47,080 --> 06:40:48,480
It was my fault that--"

3742
06:40:49,121 --> 06:40:52,960
"I blame no one," returned Phileas Fogg, with perfect calmness.

3743
06:40:53,500 --> 06:40:53,820
"Go!"

3744
06:40:54,560 --> 06:40:59,700
Passepartout left the room, and went to find Aouda, to whom he delivered his master's message.

3745
06:41:00,680 --> 06:41:04,400
"Madam," he added, "I can do nothing myself--nothing!

3746
06:41:05,000 --> 06:41:08,860
I have no influence over my master; but you, perhaps--"

3747
06:41:09,379 --> 06:41:10,940
"What influence could I have?"

3748
06:41:11,379 --> 06:41:12,080
replied Aouda.

3749
06:41:12,580 --> 06:41:14,700
"Mr. Fogg is influenced by no one.

3750
06:41:15,361 --> 06:41:19,100
Has he ever understood that my gratitude to him is overflowing?

3751
06:41:19,680 --> 06:41:21,041
Has he ever read my heart?

3752
06:41:21,740 --> 06:41:24,940
My friend, he must not be left alone an instant!

3753
06:41:25,800 --> 06:41:28,120
You say he is going to speak with me this evening?"

3754
06:41:28,580 --> 06:41:33,240
"Yes, madam; probably to arrange for your protection and comfort in England."

3755
06:41:33,941 --> 06:41:37,600
"We shall see," replied Aouda, becoming suddenly pensive.

3756
06:41:38,480 --> 06:41:53,700
Throughout this day (Sunday) the house in Saville Row was as if uninhabited, and Phileas Fogg, for the first time since he had lived in that house, did not set out for his club when Westminster clock struck half-past eleven.

3757
06:41:54,220 --> 06:41:56,320
Why should he present himself at the Reform?

3758
06:41:56,740 --> 06:41:59,080
His friends no longer expected him there.

3759
06:41:59,740 --> 06:42:07,861
As Phileas Fogg had not appeared in the saloon on the evening before (Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine), he had lost his wager.

3760
06:42:08,480 --> 06:42:22,460
It was not even necessary that he should go to his bankers for the twenty thousand pounds; for his antagonists already had his cheque in their hands, and they had only to fill it out and send it to the Barings to have the amount transferred to their credit.

3761
06:42:23,100 --> 06:42:28,000
Mr. Fogg, therefore, had no reason for going out, and so he remained at home.

3762
06:42:28,740 --> 06:42:33,500
He shut himself up in his room, and busied himself putting his affairs in order.

3763
06:42:34,240 --> 06:42:37,959
Passepartout continually ascended and descended the stairs.

3764
06:42:38,720 --> 06:42:40,260
The hours were long for him.

3765
06:42:40,861 --> 06:42:51,580
He listened at his master's door, and looked through the keyhole, as if he had a perfect right so to do, and as if he feared that something terrible might happen at any moment.

3766
06:42:52,340 --> 06:42:55,840
Sometimes he thought of Fix, but no longer in anger.

3767
06:42:56,620 --> 06:43:06,140
Fix, like all the world, had been mistaken in Phileas Fogg, and had only done his duty in tracking and arresting him; while he, Passepartout. . . .

3768
06:43:07,102 --> 06:43:11,160
This thought haunted him, and he never ceased cursing his miserable folly.

3769
06:43:12,480 --> 06:43:23,860
Finding himself too wretched to remain alone, he knocked at Aouda's door, went into her room, seated himself, without speaking, in a corner, and looked ruefully at the young woman.

3770
06:43:23,880 --> 06:43:25,420
Aouda was still pensive.

3771
06:43:26,720 --> 06:43:33,920
About half-past seven in the evening Mr. Fogg sent to know if Aouda would receive him, and in a few moments he found himself alone with her.

3772
06:43:34,500 --> 06:43:39,240
Phileas Fogg took a chair, and sat down near the fireplace, opposite Aouda.

3773
06:43:39,840 --> 06:43:42,060
No emotion was visible on his face.

3774
06:43:42,460 --> 06:43:49,260
Fogg returned was exactly the Fogg who had gone away; there was the same calm, the same impassibility.

3775
06:43:50,200 --> 06:43:59,240
He sat several minutes without speaking; then, bending his eyes on Aouda, "Madam," said he, "will you pardon me for bringing you to England?"

3776
06:43:59,900 --> 06:44:00,959
"I, Mr. Fogg!"

3777
06:44:01,459 --> 06:44:04,041
replied Aouda, checking the pulsations of her heart.

3778
06:44:04,660 --> 06:44:07,360
"Please let me finish," returned Mr. Fogg.

3779
06:44:07,980 --> 06:44:21,560
"When I decided to bring you far away from the country which was so unsafe for you, I was rich, and counted on putting a portion of my fortune at your disposal; then your existence would have been free and happy.

3780
06:44:21,580 --> 06:44:22,920
But now I am ruined."

3781
06:44:24,000 --> 06:44:37,459
"I know it, Mr. Fogg," replied Aouda; "and I ask you in my turn, will you forgive me for having followed you, and--who knows?--for having, perhaps, delayed you, and thus contributed to your ruin?"

3782
06:44:38,480 --> 06:44:47,460
"Madam, you could not remain in India, and your safety could only be assured by bringing you to such a distance that your persecutors could not take you."

3783
06:44:48,240 --> 06:44:58,559
"So, Mr. Fogg," resumed Aouda, "not content with rescuing me from a terrible death, you thought yourself bound to secure my comfort in a foreign land?"

3784
06:44:59,500 --> 06:45:03,041
"Yes, madam; but circumstances have been against me.

3785
06:45:03,840 --> 06:45:07,740
Still, I beg to place the little I have left at your service."

3786
06:45:08,340 --> 06:45:10,760
"But what will become of you, Mr. Fogg?"

3787
06:45:12,000 --> 06:45:16,620
"As for me, madam," replied the gentleman, coldly, "I have need of nothing."

3788
06:45:17,941 --> 06:45:20,920
"But how do you look upon the fate, sir, which awaits you?"

3789
06:45:21,920 --> 06:45:23,660
"As I am in the habit of doing."

3790
06:45:24,379 --> 06:45:28,720
"At least," said Aouda, "want should not overtake a man like you.

3791
06:45:29,480 --> 06:45:30,180
Your friends--"

3792
06:45:30,900 --> 06:45:33,780
"I have no friends, madam."

3793
06:45:34,020 --> 06:45:34,860
"Your relatives--"

3794
06:45:35,460 --> 06:45:37,700
"I have no longer any relatives."

3795
06:45:38,660 --> 06:45:46,040
"I pity you, then, Mr. Fogg, for solitude is a sad thing, with no heart to which to confide your griefs.

3796
06:45:46,760 --> 06:45:53,240
They say, though, that misery itself, shared by two sympathetic souls, may be borne with patience."

3797
06:45:54,200 --> 06:45:55,420
"They say so, madam."

3798
06:45:56,760 --> 06:46:04,100
"Mr. Fogg," said Aouda, rising and seizing his hand, "do you wish at once a kinswoman and friend?

3799
06:46:05,021 --> 06:46:06,580
Will you have me for your wife?"

3800
06:46:07,120 --> 06:46:09,520
Mr. Fogg, at this, rose in his turn.

3801
06:46:10,342 --> 06:46:15,020
There was an unwonted light in his eyes, and a slight trembling of his lips.

3802
06:46:15,640 --> 06:46:17,240
Aouda looked into his face.

3803
06:46:17,920 --> 06:46:29,758
The sincerity, rectitude, firmness, and sweetness of this soft glance of a noble woman, who could dare all to save him to whom she owed all, at first astonished, then penetrated him.

3804
06:46:30,580 --> 06:46:34,000
He shut his eyes for an instant, as if to avoid her look.

3805
06:46:34,940 --> 06:46:37,960
When he opened them again, "I love you!"

3806
06:46:37,980 --> 06:46:39,000
he said, simply.

3807
06:46:39,621 --> 06:46:44,900
"Yes, by all that is holiest, I love you, and I am entirely yours!"

3808
06:46:45,860 --> 06:46:46,300
"Ah!"

3809
06:46:46,660 --> 06:46:48,920
cried Aouda, pressing his hand to her heart.

3810
06:46:50,059 --> 06:46:52,799
Passepartout was summoned and appeared immediately.

3811
06:46:53,800 --> 06:47:03,500
Mr. Fogg still held Aouda's hand in his own; Passepartout understood, and his big, round face became as radiant as the tropical sun at its zenith.

3812
06:47:04,220 --> 06:47:11,180
Mr. Fogg asked him if it was not too late to notify the Reverend Samuel Wilson, of Marylebone parish, that evening.

3813
06:47:12,059 --> 06:47:16,002
Passepartout smiled his most genial smile, and said, "Never too late."

3814
06:47:16,742 --> 06:47:18,120
It was five minutes past eight.

3815
06:47:19,640 --> 06:47:21,502
"Will it be for to-morrow, Monday?"

3816
06:47:22,180 --> 06:47:25,521
"For to-morrow, Monday," said Mr. Fogg, turning to Aouda.

3817
06:47:26,280 --> 06:47:29,140
"Yes; for to-morrow, Monday," she replied.

3818
06:47:30,299 --> 06:47:33,440
Passepartout hurried off as fast as his legs could carry him.

3819
06:47:34,270 --> 06:47:37,640

Chapter 36

3825
06:48:01,490 --> 06:48:05,570
IN WHICH PHILEAS FOGG'S NAME IS ONCE MORE AT A PREMIUM ON 'CHANGE

3826
06:48:05,680 --> 06:48:19,520
It is time to relate what a change took place in English public opinion when it transpired that the real bankrobber, a certain James Strand, had been arrested, on the 17th day of December, at Edinburgh.

3827
06:48:20,440 --> 06:48:32,220
Three days before, Phileas Fogg had been a criminal, who was being desperately followed up by the police; now he was an honourable gentleman, mathematically pursuing his eccentric journey round the world.

3828
06:48:33,300 --> 06:48:47,560
The papers resumed their discussion about the wager; all those who had laid bets, for or against him, revived their interest, as if by magic; the "Phileas Fogg bonds" again became negotiable, and many new wagers were made.

3829
06:48:48,121 --> 06:48:51,781
Phileas Fogg's name was once more at a premium on 'Change.

3830
06:48:52,880 --> 06:48:58,201
His five friends of the Reform Club passed these three days in a state of feverish suspense.

3831
06:48:58,941 --> 06:49:02,980
Would Phileas Fogg, whom they had forgotten, reappear before their eyes!

3832
06:49:03,420 --> 06:49:04,560
Where was he at this moment?

3833
06:49:05,240 --> 06:49:14,800
The 17th of December, the day of James Strand's arrest, was the seventy-sixth since Phileas Fogg's departure, and no news of him had been received.

3834
06:49:15,479 --> 06:49:16,060
Was he dead?

3835
06:49:16,521 --> 06:49:21,920
Had he abandoned the effort, or was he continuing his journey along the route agreed upon?

3836
06:49:21,940 --> 06:49:29,898
And would he appear on Saturday, the 21st of December, at a quarter before nine in the evening, on the threshold of the Reform Club saloon?

3837
06:49:31,080 --> 06:49:36,838
The anxiety in which, for three days, London society existed, cannot be described.

3838
06:49:37,379 --> 06:49:41,398
Telegrams were sent to America and Asia for news of Phileas Fogg.

3839
06:49:42,200 --> 06:49:46,719
Messengers were dispatched to the house in Saville Row morning and evening.

3840
06:49:46,738 --> 06:49:47,440
No news.

3841
06:49:47,979 --> 06:49:54,680
The police were ignorant what had become of the detective, Fix, who had so unfortunately followed up a false scent.

3842
06:49:55,400 --> 06:49:58,120
Bets increased, nevertheless, in number and value.

3843
06:49:58,780 --> 06:50:03,360
Phileas Fogg, like a racehorse, was drawing near his last turning-point.

3844
06:50:04,021 --> 06:50:15,220
The bonds were quoted, no longer at a hundred below par, but at twenty, at ten, and at five; and paralytic old Lord Albemarle bet even in his favour.

3845
06:50:16,102 --> 06:50:26,059
A great crowd was collected in Pall Mall and the neighbouring streets on Saturday evening; it seemed like a multitude of brokers permanently established around the Reform Club.

3846
06:50:26,861 --> 06:50:33,000
Circulation was impeded, and everywhere disputes, discussions, and financial transactions were going on.

3847
06:50:33,700 --> 06:50:43,521
The police had great difficulty in keeping back the crowd, and as the hour when Phileas Fogg was due approached, the excitement rose to its highest pitch.

3848
06:50:44,420 --> 06:50:48,780
The five antagonists of Phileas Fogg had met in the great saloon of the club.

3849
06:50:49,400 --> 06:51:02,040
John Sullivan and Samuel Fallentin, the bankers, Andrew Stuart, the engineer, Gauthier Ralph, the director of the Bank of England, and Thomas Flanagan, the brewer, one and all waited anxiously.

3850
06:51:03,102 --> 06:51:13,980
When the clock indicated twenty minutes past eight, Andrew Stuart got up, saying, "Gentlemen, in twenty minutes the time agreed upon between Mr. Fogg and ourselves will have expired."

3851
06:51:14,640 --> 06:51:17,420
"What time did the last train arrive from Liverpool?"

3852
06:51:17,820 --> 06:51:18,879
asked Thomas Flanagan.

3853
06:51:19,459 --> 06:51:26,178
"At twenty-three minutes past seven," replied Gauthier Ralph; "and the next does not arrive till ten minutes after twelve."

3854
06:51:26,820 --> 06:51:34,840
"Well, gentlemen," resumed Andrew Stuart, "if Phileas Fogg had come in the 7:23 train, he would have got here by this time.

3855
06:51:35,379 --> 06:51:37,940
We can, therefore, regard the bet as won."

3856
06:51:38,602 --> 06:51:42,380
"Wait; don't let us be too hasty," replied Samuel Fallentin.

3857
06:51:42,879 --> 06:51:45,379
"You know that Mr. Fogg is very eccentric.

3858
06:51:45,900 --> 06:51:55,160
His punctuality is well known; he never arrives too soon, or too late; and I should not be surprised if he appeared before us at the last minute."

3859
06:51:55,781 --> 06:52:01,700
"Why," said Andrew Stuart nervously, "if I should see him, I should not believe it was he."

3860
06:52:02,280 --> 06:52:07,121
"The fact is," resumed Thomas Flanagan, "Mr. Fogg's project was absurdly foolish.

3861
06:52:07,621 --> 06:52:16,580
Whatever his punctuality, he could not prevent the delays which were certain to occur; and a delay of only two or three days would be fatal to his tour."

3862
06:52:17,080 --> 06:52:25,280
"Observe, too," added John Sullivan, "that we have received no intelligence from him, though there are telegraphic lines all along his route."

3863
06:52:26,080 --> 06:52:30,540
"He has lost, gentleman," said Andrew Stuart, "he has a hundred times lost!

3864
06:52:31,000 --> 06:52:38,701
You know, besides, that the China the only steamer he could have taken from New York to get here in time arrived yesterday.

3865
06:52:38,720 --> 06:52:43,621
I have seen a list of the passengers, and the name of Phileas Fogg is not among them.

3866
06:52:44,220 --> 06:52:49,059
Even if we admit that fortune has favoured him, he can scarcely have reached America.

3867
06:52:49,640 --> 06:52:56,682
I think he will be at least twenty days behind-hand, and that Lord Albemarle will lose a cool five thousand."

3868
06:52:57,220 --> 06:53:04,559
"It is clear," replied Gauthier Ralph; "and we have nothing to do but to present Mr. Fogg's cheque at Barings to-morrow."

3869
06:53:05,120 --> 06:53:09,262
At this moment, the hands of the club clock pointed to twenty minutes to nine.

3870
06:53:09,820 --> 06:53:12,120
"Five minutes more," said Andrew Stuart.

3871
06:53:12,880 --> 06:53:14,560
The five gentlemen looked at each other.

3872
06:53:14,979 --> 06:53:22,820
Their anxiety was becoming intense; but, not wishing to betray it, they readily assented to Mr. Fallentin's proposal of a rubber.

3873
06:53:23,340 --> 06:53:32,200
"I wouldn't give up my four thousand of the bet," said Andrew Stuart, as he took his seat, "for three thousand nine hundred and ninety-nine."

3874
06:53:32,260 --> 06:53:34,640
The clock indicated eighteen minutes to nine.

3875
06:53:35,320 --> 06:53:39,240
The players took up their cards, but could not keep their eyes off the clock.

3876
06:53:39,781 --> 06:53:44,400
Certainly, however secure they felt, minutes had never seemed so long to them!

3877
06:53:45,020 --> 06:53:50,520
"Seventeen minutes to nine," said Thomas Flanagan, as he cut the cards which Ralph handed to him.

3878
06:53:51,020 --> 06:53:52,900
Then there was a moment of silence.

3879
06:53:53,280 --> 06:54:00,300
The great saloon was perfectly quiet; but the murmurs of the crowd outside were heard, with now and then a shrill cry.

3880
06:54:00,920 --> 06:54:07,320
The pendulum beat the seconds, which each player eagerly counted, as he listened, with mathematical regularity.

3881
06:54:07,900 --> 06:54:09,760
"Sixteen minutes to nine!"

3882
06:54:10,140 --> 06:54:13,262
said John Sullivan, in a voice which betrayed his emotion.

3883
06:54:13,300 --> 06:54:17,102
One minute more, and the wager would be won.

3884
06:54:17,121 --> 06:54:20,000
Andrew Stuart and his partners suspended their game.

3885
06:54:20,639 --> 06:54:22,941
They left their cards, and counted the seconds.

3886
06:54:23,738 --> 06:54:26,102
At the fortieth second, nothing.

3887
06:54:26,220 --> 06:54:28,160
At the fiftieth, still nothing.

3888
06:54:29,160 --> 06:54:36,959
At the fifty-fifth, a loud cry was heard in the street, followed by applause, hurrahs, and some fierce growls.

3889
06:54:37,000 --> 06:54:39,459
The players rose from their seats.

3890
06:54:40,200 --> 06:54:57,559
At the fifty-seventh second the door of the saloon opened; and the pendulum had not beat the sixtieth second when Phileas Fogg appeared, followed by an excited crowd who had forced their way through the club doors, and in his calm voice, said, "Here I am, gentlemen!"

Around the World in Eighty Days

06:55:21,988 --> 06:55:23,790
Chapter 37

3897
06:55:23,790 --> 06:55:31,680
IN WHICH IT IS SHOWN THAT PHILEAS FOGG GAINED NOTHING BY HIS TOUR AROUND THE WORLD, UNLESS IT WERE HAPPINESS

3898
06:55:32,498 --> 06:55:34,281
Yes; Phileas Fogg in person.

3899
06:55:35,299 --> 06:55:53,400
The reader will remember that at five minutes past eight in the evening--about five and twenty hours after the arrival of the travellers in London--Passepartout had been sent by his master to engage the services of the Reverend Samuel Wilson in a certain marriage ceremony, which was to take place the next day.

3900
06:55:54,120 --> 06:55:56,620
Passepartout went on his errand enchanted.

3901
06:55:57,121 --> 06:56:00,658
He soon reached the clergyman's house, but found him not at home.

3902
06:56:01,240 --> 06:56:07,639
Passepartout waited a good twenty minutes, and when he left the reverend gentleman, it was thirty-five minutes past eight.

3903
06:56:08,520 --> 06:56:10,080
But in what a state he was!

3904
06:56:10,379 --> 06:56:20,840
With his hair in disorder, and without his hat, he ran along the street as never man was seen to run before, overturning passers-by, rushing over the sidewalk like a waterspout.

3905
06:56:21,441 --> 06:56:26,220
In three minutes he was in Saville Row again, and staggered back into Mr. Fogg's room.

3906
06:56:26,840 --> 06:56:27,660
He could not speak.

3907
06:56:28,380 --> 06:56:29,180
"What is the matter?"

3908
06:56:29,521 --> 06:56:30,340
asked Mr. Fogg.

3909
06:56:30,818 --> 06:56:31,559
"My master!"

3910
06:56:31,799 --> 06:56:35,182
gasped Passepartout--"marriage--impossible--"

3911
06:56:35,840 --> 06:56:36,680
"Impossible?"

3912
06:56:37,160 --> 06:56:38,898
"Impossible--for to-morrow."

3913
06:56:39,520 --> 06:56:40,040
"Why so?"

3914
06:56:40,719 --> 06:56:42,980
"Because to-morrow--is Sunday!"

3915
06:56:43,880 --> 06:56:45,541
"Monday," replied Mr. Fogg.

3916
06:56:46,140 --> 06:56:48,342
"No--to-day is Saturday."

3917
06:56:49,160 --> 06:56:49,822
"Saturday?

3918
06:56:50,459 --> 06:56:51,262
Impossible!"

3919
06:56:51,879 --> 06:56:53,441
"Yes, yes, yes, yes!"

3920
06:56:53,640 --> 06:56:54,582
cried Passepartout.

3921
06:56:54,780 --> 06:56:56,600
"You have made a mistake of one day!

3922
06:56:56,900 --> 06:57:01,800
We arrived twenty-four hours ahead of time; but there are only ten minutes left!"

3923
06:57:02,441 --> 06:57:07,959
Passepartout had seized his master by the collar, and was dragging him along with irresistible force.

3924
06:57:08,560 --> 06:57:21,640
Phileas Fogg, thus kidnapped, without having time to think, left his house, jumped into a cab, promised a hundred pounds to the cabman, and, having run over two dogs and overturned five carriages, reached the Reform Club.

3925
06:57:22,742 --> 06:57:26,840
The clock indicated a quarter before nine when he appeared in the great saloon.

3926
06:57:27,340 --> 06:57:31,760
Phileas Fogg had accomplished the journey round the world in eighty days!

3927
06:57:32,180 --> 06:57:35,918
Phileas Fogg had won his wager of twenty thousand pounds!

3928
06:57:36,360 --> 06:57:41,201
How was it that a man so exact and fastidious could have made this error of a day?

3929
06:57:42,000 --> 06:57:53,041
How came he to think that he had arrived in London on Saturday, the twenty-first day of December, when it was really Friday, the twentieth, the seventy-ninth day only from his departure?

3930
06:57:53,658 --> 06:57:55,980
The cause of the error is very simple.

3931
06:57:56,940 --> 06:58:11,701
Phileas Fogg had, without suspecting it, gained one day on his journey, and this merely because he had travelled constantly eastward; he would, on the contrary, have lost a day had he gone in the opposite direction, that is, westward.

3932
06:58:12,340 --> 06:58:22,720
In journeying eastward he had gone towards the sun, and the days therefore diminished for him as many times four minutes as he crossed degrees in this direction.

3933
06:58:23,299 --> 06:58:37,398
There are three hundred and sixty degrees on the circumference of the earth; and these three hundred and sixty degrees, multiplied by four minutes, gives precisely twenty-four hours--that is, the day unconsciously gained.

3934
06:58:38,280 --> 06:58:49,840
In other words, while Phileas Fogg, going eastward, saw the sun pass the meridian eighty times, his friends in London only saw it pass the meridian seventy-nine times.

3935
06:58:50,440 --> 06:58:56,320
This is why they awaited him at the Reform Club on Saturday, and not Sunday, as Mr. Fogg thought.

3936
06:58:57,479 --> 06:59:07,600
And Passepartout's famous family watch, which had always kept London time, would have betrayed this fact, if it had marked the days as well as the hours and the minutes!

3937
06:59:08,639 --> 06:59:17,820
Phileas Fogg, then, had won the twenty thousand pounds; but, as he had spent nearly nineteen thousand on the way, the pecuniary gain was small.

3938
06:59:18,240 --> 06:59:21,860
His object was, however, to be victorious, and not to win money.

3939
06:59:22,420 --> 06:59:30,440
He divided the one thousand pounds that remained between Passepartout and the unfortunate Fix, against whom he cherished no grudge.

3940
06:59:31,102 --> 06:59:40,680
He deducted, however, from Passepartout's share the cost of the gas which had burned in his room for nineteen hundred and twenty hours, for the sake of regularity.

3941
06:59:41,780 --> 06:59:48,800
That evening, Mr. Fogg, as tranquil and phlegmatic as ever, said to Aouda: "Is our marriage still agreeable to you?"

3942
06:59:49,762 --> 06:59:53,941
"Mr. Fogg," replied she, "it is for me to ask that question.

3943
06:59:54,460 --> 06:59:57,258
You were ruined, but now you are rich again."

3944
06:59:58,280 --> 07:00:00,959
"Pardon me, madam; my fortune belongs to you.

3945
07:00:01,740 --> 07:00:10,422
If you had not suggested our marriage, my servant would not have gone to the Reverend Samuel Wilson's, I should not have been apprised of my error, and--"

3946
07:00:11,140 --> 07:00:12,340
"Dear Mr. Fogg!"

3947
07:00:12,639 --> 07:00:13,398
said the young woman.

3948
07:00:13,918 --> 07:00:14,639
"Dear Aouda!"

3949
07:00:14,960 --> 07:00:16,060
replied Phileas Fogg.

3950
07:00:17,219 --> 07:00:25,418
It need not be said that the marriage took place forty-eight hours after, and that Passepartout, glowing and dazzling, gave the bride away.

3951
07:00:26,080 --> 07:00:29,340
Had he not saved her, and was he not entitled to this honour?

3952
07:00:30,620 --> 07:00:36,361
The next day, as soon as it was light, Passepartout rapped vigorously at his master's door.

3953
07:00:37,000 --> 07:00:40,120
Mr. Fogg opened it, and asked, "What's the matter, Passepartout?"

3954
07:00:40,660 --> 07:00:41,420
"What is it, sir?

3955
07:00:41,920 --> 07:00:43,959
Why, I've just this instant found out--"

3956
07:00:44,340 --> 07:00:44,762
"What?"

3957
07:00:45,480 --> 07:00:49,320
"That we might have made the tour of the world in only seventy-eight days."

3958
07:00:50,281 --> 07:00:53,880
"No doubt," returned Mr. Fogg, "by not crossing India.

3959
07:00:54,560 --> 07:01:00,959
But if I had not crossed India, I should not have saved Aouda; she would not have been my wife, and--"

3960
07:01:01,941 --> 07:01:03,920
Mr. Fogg quietly shut the door.

3961
07:01:05,441 --> 07:01:10,140
Phileas Fogg had won his wager, and had made his journey around the world in eighty days.

3962
07:01:10,701 --> 07:01:19,840
To do this he had employed every means of conveyance--steamers, railways, carriages, yachts, trading-vessels, sledges, elephants.

3963
07:01:20,658 --> 07:01:27,120
The eccentric gentleman had throughout displayed all his marvellous qualities of coolness and exactitude.

3964
07:01:28,220 --> 07:01:28,800
But what then?

3965
07:01:29,560 --> 07:01:31,740
What had he really gained by all this trouble?

3966
07:01:32,682 --> 07:01:35,941
What had he brought back from this long and weary journey?

3967
07:01:37,082 --> 07:01:38,002
Nothing, say you?

3968
07:01:38,660 --> 07:01:46,100
Perhaps so; nothing but a charming woman, who, strange as it may appear, made him the happiest of men!

3969
07:01:46,998 --> 07:01:51,140
Truly, would you not for less than that make the tour around the world?
