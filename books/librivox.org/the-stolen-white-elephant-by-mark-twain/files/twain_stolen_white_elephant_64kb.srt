The Stolen White Elephant
by
Mark Twain

5
00:00:12,780 --> 00:00:19,280
Left out of A Tramp Abroad, because it was feared that some of the particulars had been exaggerated, and that others were not true.

6
00:00:19,280 --> 00:00:23,550
Before these suspicions had been proven groundless, the book had gone to press. —M.

7
00:00:23,550 --> 00:00:24,800
T.

8
00:00:26,080 --> 00:00:30,130
The following curious history was related to me by a chance railway acquaintance.

9
00:00:30,130 --> 00:00:41,510
He was a gentleman more than seventy years of age, and his thoroughly good and gentle face and earnest and sincere manner imprinted the unmistakable stamp of truth upon every statement which fell from his lips.

10
00:00:41,510 --> 00:00:47,530
He said: You know in what reverence the royal white elephant of Siam is held by the people of that country.

11
00:00:47,530 --> 00:00:57,330
You know it is sacred to kings, only kings may possess it, and that it is, indeed, in a measure even superior to kings, since it receives not merely honor but worship.

12
00:00:57,330 --> 00:01:07,120
Very well; five years ago, when the troubles concerning the frontier line arose between Great Britain and Siam, it was presently manifest that Siam had been in the wrong.

13
00:01:07,120 --> 00:01:14,140
Therefore every reparation was quickly made, and the British representative stated that he was satisfied and the past should be forgotten.

14
00:01:14,140 --> 00:01:24,240
This greatly relieved the King of Siam, and partly as a token of gratitude, but partly also, perhaps, to wipe out any little remaining vestige of unpleasantness which England might feel toward him,

15
00:01:24,240 --> 00:01:30,410
he wished to send the Queen a present—the sole sure way of propitiating an enemy, according to Oriental ideas.

16
00:01:30,410 --> 00:01:36,120
This present ought not only to be a royal one, but transcendently royal.

17
00:01:36,120 --> 00:01:40,600
Wherefore, what offering could be so meet as that of a white elephant?

18
00:01:40,600 --> 00:01:47,570
My position in the Indian civil service was such that I was deemed peculiarly worthy of the honor of conveying the present to her Majesty.

19
00:01:47,570 --> 00:01:58,060
A ship was fitted out for me and my servants and the officers and attendants of the elephant, and in due time I arrived in New York harbor and placed my royal charge in admirable quarters in Jersey City.

20
00:01:58,060 --> 00:02:03,610
It was necessary to remain awhile in order to recruit the animal's health before resuming the voyage.

21
00:02:03,610 --> 00:02:07,880
All went well during a fortnight—then my calamities began.

22
00:02:07,880 --> 00:02:10,210
The white elephant was stolen!

23
00:02:10,210 --> 00:02:14,080
I was called up at dead of night and informed of this fearful misfortune.

24
00:02:14,080 --> 00:02:19,360
For some moments I was beside myself with terror and anxiety; I was helpless.

25
00:02:19,360 --> 00:02:22,540
Then I grew calmer and collected my faculties.

26
00:02:22,540 --> 00:02:27,640
I soon saw my course—for, indeed, there was but the one course for an intelligent man to pursue.

27
00:02:27,640 --> 00:02:33,700
Late as it was, I flew to New York and got a policeman to conduct me to the headquarters of the detective force.

28
00:02:33,700 --> 00:02:42,040
Fortunately I arrived in time, though the chief of the force, the celebrated Inspector Blunt was just on the point of leaving for his home.

29
00:02:42,040 --> 00:02:56,080
He was a man of middle size and compact frame, and when he was thinking deeply he had a way of kniting his brows and tapping his forehead reflectively with his finger, which impressed you at once with the conviction that you stood in the presence of a person of no common order.

30
00:02:56,080 --> 00:02:59,200
The very sight of him gave me confidence and made me hopeful.

31
00:02:59,200 --> 00:03:00,760
I stated my errand.

32
00:03:00,760 --> 00:03:08,820
It did not flurry him in the least; it had no more visible effect upon his iron self-possession than if I had told him somebody had stolen my dog.

33
00:03:08,820 --> 00:03:14,470
He motioned me to a seat, and said, calmly: “Allow me to think a moment, please.”

34
00:03:14,470 --> 00:03:18,800
So saying, he sat down at his office table and leaned his head upon his hand.

35
00:03:18,800 --> 00:03:25,450
Several clerks were at work at the other end of the room; the scratching of their pens was all the sound I heard during the next six or seven minutes.

36
00:03:25,450 --> 00:03:29,040
Meantime the inspector sat there, buried in thought.

37
00:03:29,040 --> 00:03:37,030
Finally he raised his head, and there was that in the firm lines of his face which showed me that his brain had done its work and his plan was made.

38
00:03:37,030 --> 00:03:40,550
Said he—and his voice was low and impressive:

39
00:03:40,550 --> 00:03:42,910
“This is no ordinary case.

40
00:03:42,910 --> 00:03:48,820
Every step must be warily taken; each step must be made sure before the next is ventured.

41
00:03:48,820 --> 00:03:54,010
And secrecy must be observed—secrecy profound and absolute.

42
00:03:54,010 --> 00:03:58,610
Speak to no one about the matter, not even the reporters.

43
00:03:58,610 --> 00:04:04,660
I will take care of them; I will see that they get only what it may suit my ends to let them know.”

44
00:04:04,660 --> 00:04:07,580
He touched a bell; a youth appeared.

45
00:04:07,580 --> 00:04:11,190
“Alaric, tell the reporters to remain for the present.”

46
00:04:11,190 --> 00:04:13,140
The boy retired.

47
00:04:13,140 --> 00:04:16,640
“Now let us proceed to business—and systematically.

48
00:04:16,640 --> 00:04:21,220
Nothing can be accomplished in this trade of mine without strict and minute method.”

49
00:04:21,220 --> 00:04:23,280
He took a pen and some paper.

50
00:04:23,280 --> 00:04:26,200
“Now—name of the elephant?”

51
00:04:26,200 --> 00:04:36,920
“Hassan Ben Ali Ben Selim Abdallah Mohammed Moisé Alhammal Jamsetjejeebhoy Dhuleep Sultan Ebu Bhudpoor.”

52
00:04:38,100 --> 00:04:38,670
“Very well.

53
00:04:38,670 --> 00:04:39,890
Given name?”

54
00:04:39,890 --> 00:04:41,580
“Jumbo.”

55
00:04:41,580 --> 00:04:42,880
“Very well.

56
00:04:42,880 --> 00:04:44,060
Place of birth?”

57
00:04:44,060 --> 00:04:46,360
“The capital city of Siam.”

58
00:04:46,360 --> 00:04:47,850
“Parents living?”

59
00:04:47,850 --> 00:04:49,880
“No—dead.”

60
00:04:49,880 --> 00:04:52,810
“Had they any other issue besides this one?”

61
00:04:52,810 --> 00:04:53,750
“None.

62
00:04:53,750 --> 00:04:55,800
He was an only child.”

63
00:04:55,800 --> 00:04:57,140
“Very well.

64
00:04:57,140 --> 00:04:59,120
These matters are sufficient under that head.

65
00:04:59,120 --> 00:05:06,150
Now please describe the elephant, and leave out no particular, however insignificant—that is, insignificant from your point of view.

66
00:05:06,150 --> 00:05:11,540
To men in my profession there are no insignificant particulars; they do not exist.”

67
00:05:11,540 --> 00:05:13,980
I described, he wrote.

68
00:05:13,980 --> 00:05:16,010
When I was done, he said: “Now listen.

69
00:05:16,010 --> 00:05:17,960
If I have made any mistakes, correct me.”

70
00:05:17,960 --> 00:05:35,170
He read as follows: “Height, 19 feet; length from apex of forehead to insertion of tail, 26 feet; length of trunk, 16 feet; length of tail, 6 feet; total length, including trunk, and tail, 48 feet; length of tusks, 9 1/2 feet;

71
00:05:35,170 --> 00:05:44,180
ears keeping with these dimensions; footprint resembles the mark left when one up-ends a barrel in the snow; color of the elephant, a dull white;

72
00:05:44,180 --> 00:05:58,490
has a hole the size of a plate in each ear for the insertion of jewelry and possesses the habit in a remarkable degree of squirting water upon spectators and of maltreating with his trunk not only such persons as he is acquainted with, but even entire strangers;

73
00:05:58,490 --> 00:06:12,010
limps slightly with his right hind leg, and has a small scar in his left armpit caused by a former boil; had on, when stolen, a castle containing seats for fifteen persons, and a gold-cloth saddle-blanket the size of an ordinary carpet.”

74
00:06:12,010 --> 00:06:13,830
There were no mistakes.

75
00:06:13,830 --> 00:06:23,690
The inspector touched the bell, handed the description to Alaric, and said: “Have fifty thousand copies of this printed at once and mailed to every detective office and pawnbroker's shop on the continent.”

76
00:06:23,690 --> 00:06:25,330
Alaric retired.

77
00:06:25,330 --> 00:06:27,280
“There—so far, so good.

78
00:06:27,280 --> 00:06:30,300
Next, I must have a photograph of the property.”

79
00:06:30,300 --> 00:06:31,780
I gave him one.

80
00:06:31,780 --> 00:06:38,900
He examined it critically, and said: “It must do, since we can do no better; but he has his trunk curled up and tucked into his mouth.

81
00:06:38,900 --> 00:06:44,320
That is unfortunate, and is calculated to mislead, for of course he does not usually have it in that position.”

82
00:06:44,320 --> 00:06:45,990
He touched his bell.

83
00:06:45,990 --> 00:06:52,950
“Alaric, have fifty thousand copies of this photograph made the first thing in the morning, and mail them with the descriptive circulars.”

84
00:06:52,950 --> 00:06:55,720
Alaric retired to execute his orders.

85
00:06:55,720 --> 00:07:00,230
The inspector said: “It will be necessary to offer a reward, of course.

86
00:07:00,230 --> 00:07:02,310
Now as to the amount?”

87
00:07:02,310 --> 00:07:04,290
“What sum would you suggest?”

88
00:07:04,290 --> 00:07:08,270
“To begin with, I should say—well, twenty-five thousand dollars.

89
00:07:08,270 --> 00:07:14,430
It is an intricate and difficult business; there are a thousand avenues of escape and opportunities of concealment.

90
00:07:14,430 --> 00:07:17,760
These thieves have friends and pals everywhere—”

91
00:07:17,760 --> 00:07:20,540
“Bless me, do you know who they are?”

92
00:07:20,540 --> 00:07:30,650
The wary face, practised in concealing the thoughts and feelings within, gave me no token, nor yet the replying words, so quietly uttered: “Never mind about that.

93
00:07:30,650 --> 00:07:32,550
I may, and I may not.

94
00:07:32,550 --> 00:07:38,660
We generally gather a pretty shrewd inkling of who our man is by the manner of his work and the size of the game he goes after.

95
00:07:38,660 --> 00:07:43,120
We are not dealing with a pickpocket or a hall thief now, make up your mind to that.

96
00:07:43,120 --> 00:07:45,740
This property was not 'lifted' by a novice.

97
00:07:45,740 --> 00:08:00,220
But, as I was saying, considering the amount of travel which will have to be done, and the diligence with which the thieves will cover up their traces as they move along, twenty-five thousand may be too small a sum to offer, yet I think it worth while to start with that.”

98
00:08:00,220 --> 00:08:02,910
So we determined upon that figure as a beginning.

99
00:08:02,910 --> 00:08:16,800
Then this man, whom nothing escaped which could by any possibility be made to serve as a clue, said: “There are cases in detective history to show that criminals have been detected through peculiarities, in their appetites.

100
00:08:16,800 --> 00:08:20,580
Now, what does this elephant eat, and how much?”

101
00:08:20,580 --> 00:08:25,000
“Well, as to what he eats—he will eat anything.

102
00:08:25,000 --> 00:08:29,730
He will eat a man, he will eat a Bible—he will eat anything between a man and a Bible.”

103
00:08:29,730 --> 00:08:32,870
“Good very good, indeed, but too general.

104
00:08:32,870 --> 00:08:37,410
Details are necessary—details are the only valuable things in our trade.

105
00:08:37,410 --> 00:08:39,450
Very well—as to men.

106
00:08:39,450 --> 00:08:45,680
At one meal—or, if you prefer, during one day—how man men will he eat, if fresh?”

107
00:08:45,680 --> 00:08:51,870
“He would not care whether they were fresh or not; at a single meal he would eat five ordinary men.”

108
00:08:51,870 --> 00:08:54,550
“Very good; five men; we will put that down.

109
00:08:54,550 --> 00:08:56,770
What nationalities would he prefer?”

110
00:08:56,770 --> 00:08:59,160
“He is indifferent about nationalities.

111
00:08:59,160 --> 00:09:02,690
He prefers acquaintances, but is not prejudiced against strangers.”

112
00:09:02,690 --> 00:09:03,470
“Very good.

113
00:09:03,470 --> 00:09:04,900
Now, as to Bibles.

114
00:09:04,900 --> 00:09:07,180
How many Bibles would he eat at a meal?”

115
00:09:07,180 --> 00:09:09,620
“He would eat an entire edition.”

116
00:09:09,620 --> 00:09:11,420
“It is hardly succinct enough.

117
00:09:11,420 --> 00:09:15,590
Do you mean the ordinary octavo, or the family illustrated?”

118
00:09:15,590 --> 00:09:21,870
“I think he would be indifferent to illustrations that is, I think he would not value illustrations above simple letterpress.”

119
00:09:21,870 --> 00:09:24,240
“No, you do not get my idea.

120
00:09:24,240 --> 00:09:26,030
I refer to bulk.

121
00:09:26,030 --> 00:09:33,570
The ordinary octavo Bible weighs about two pounds and a half, while the great quarto with the illustrations weighs ten or twelve.

122
00:09:33,570 --> 00:09:36,440
How many Dore Bibles would he eat at a meal?”

123
00:09:36,440 --> 00:09:39,000
“If you knew this elephant, you could not ask.

124
00:09:39,000 --> 00:09:41,070
He would take what they had.”

125
00:09:41,070 --> 00:09:43,810
“Well, put it in dollars and cents, then.

126
00:09:43,810 --> 00:09:45,480
We must get at it somehow.

127
00:09:45,480 --> 00:09:49,220
The Dore costs a hundred dollars a copy, Russia leather, beveled.”

128
00:09:49,220 --> 00:09:55,680
“He would require about fifty thousand dollars worth—say an edition of five hundred copies.”

129
00:09:55,680 --> 00:09:57,560
“Now that is more exact.

130
00:09:57,560 --> 00:09:58,820
I will put that down.

131
00:09:58,820 --> 00:10:02,050
Very well; he likes men and Bibles; so far, so good.

132
00:10:02,050 --> 00:10:03,050
What else will he eat?

133
00:10:03,050 --> 00:10:05,260
I want particulars.”

134
00:10:05,260 --> 00:10:18,000
“He will leave Bibles to eat bricks, he will leave bricks to eat bottles, he will leave bottles to eat clothing, he will leave clothing to eat cats, he will leave cats to eat oysters, he will leave oysters to eat ham,

135
00:10:18,000 --> 00:10:33,760
he will leave ham to eat sugar, he will leave sugar to eat pie, he will leave pie to eat potatoes, he will leave potatoes to eat bran; he will leave bran to eat hay, he will leave hay to eat oats, he will leave oats to eat rice, for he was mainly raised on it.

136
00:10:33,760 --> 00:10:39,880
There is nothing whatever that he will not eat but European butter, and he would eat that if he could taste it.”

137
00:10:39,880 --> 00:10:41,340
“Very good.

138
00:10:41,340 --> 00:10:44,160
General quantity at a meal—say about—”

139
00:10:44,160 --> 00:10:48,130
“Well, anywhere from a quarter to half a ton.”

140
00:10:48,130 --> 00:10:49,810
“And he drinks—”

141
00:10:49,810 --> 00:10:51,370
“Everything that is fluid.

142
00:10:51,370 --> 00:11:01,320
Milk, water, whisky, molasses, castor oil, camphene, carbolic acid—it is no use to go into particulars; whatever fluid occurs to you set it down.

143
00:11:01,320 --> 00:11:06,440
He will drink anything that is fluid, except European coffee.”

144
00:11:06,440 --> 00:11:07,990
“Very good.

145
00:11:07,990 --> 00:11:09,670
As to quantity?”

146
00:11:09,670 --> 00:11:15,900
“Put it down five to fifteen barrels—his thirst varies; his other appetites do not.”

147
00:11:15,900 --> 00:11:17,890
“These things are unusual.

148
00:11:17,890 --> 00:11:20,950
They ought to furnish quite good clues toward tracing him.”

149
00:11:20,950 --> 00:11:22,500
He touched the bell.

150
00:11:22,500 --> 00:11:25,170
“Alaric; summon Captain Burns.”

151
00:11:25,170 --> 00:11:26,670
Burns appeared.

152
00:11:26,670 --> 00:11:30,150
Inspector Blunt unfolded the whole matter to him, detail by detail.

153
00:11:30,150 --> 00:11:43,350
Then he said in the clear, decisive tones of a man whose plans are clearly defined in his head and who is accustomed to command: “Captain Burns, detail Detectives Jones, Davis, Halsey, Bates, and Hackett to shadow the elephant.”

154
00:11:43,350 --> 00:11:44,420
“Yes, sir.”

155
00:11:44,420 --> 00:11:51,110
“Detail Detectives Moses, Dakin, Murphy, Rogers, Tupper, Higgins, and Bartholomew to shadow the thieves.”

156
00:11:51,110 --> 00:11:52,290
“Yes, sir.”

157
00:11:52,290 --> 00:12:05,340
“Place a strong guard—A guard of thirty picked men, with a relief of thirty—over the place from whence the elephant was stolen, to keep strict watch there night and day, and allow none to approach—except reporters—without written authority from me.”

158
00:12:05,340 --> 00:12:06,120
“Yes, sir.”

159
00:12:06,120 --> 00:12:16,480
“Place detectives in plain clothes in the railway; steamship, and ferry depots, and upon all roadways leading out of Jersey City, with orders to search all suspicious persons.”

160
00:12:16,480 --> 00:12:17,510
“Yes, sir.”

161
00:12:17,510 --> 00:12:25,740
“Furnish all these men with photograph and accompanying description of the elephant, and instruct them to search all trains and outgoing ferryboats and other vessels.”

162
00:12:25,740 --> 00:12:26,760
“Yes, sir.”

163
00:12:26,760 --> 00:12:31,930
“If the elephant should be found, let him be seized, and the information forwarded to me by telegraph.”

164
00:12:31,930 --> 00:12:33,290
“Yes, sir.”

165
00:12:33,290 --> 00:12:39,250
“Let me be informed at once if any clues should be found—footprints of the animal, or anything of that kind.”

166
00:12:39,250 --> 00:12:40,540
“Yes, sir.”

167
00:12:40,540 --> 00:12:44,930
“Get an order commanding the harbor police to patrol the frontages vigilantly.”

168
00:12:44,930 --> 00:12:46,170
“Yes, sir.”

169
00:12:46,170 --> 00:12:54,240
“Despatch detectives in plain clothes over all the railways, north as far as Canada, west as far as Ohio, south as far as Washington.”

170
00:12:54,240 --> 00:12:55,450
“Yes, sir.”

171
00:12:55,450 --> 00:13:03,190
“Place experts in all the telegraph offices to listen to all messages; and let them require that all cipher despatches be interpreted to them.”

172
00:13:03,190 --> 00:13:04,490
“Yes, sir.”

173
00:13:04,490 --> 00:13:10,190
“Let all these things be done with the utmost's secrecy—mind, the most impenetrable secrecy.”

174
00:13:10,190 --> 00:13:11,840
“Yes, sir.”

175
00:13:11,840 --> 00:13:14,670
“Report to me promptly at the usual hour.”

176
00:13:14,670 --> 00:13:15,910
“Yes, Sir.”

177
00:13:15,910 --> 00:13:17,150
“Go!”

178
00:13:17,150 --> 00:13:18,800
“Yes, sir.”

179
00:13:18,800 --> 00:13:20,390
He was gone.

180
00:13:20,390 --> 00:13:26,140
Inspector Blunt was silent and thoughtful a moment, while the fire in his eye cooled down and faded out.

181
00:13:26,140 --> 00:13:34,320
Then he turned to me and said in a placid voice: “I am not given to boasting, it is not my habit; but—we shall find the elephant.”

182
00:13:34,320 --> 00:13:38,960
I shook him warmly by the hand and thanked him; and I FELT my thanks, too.

183
00:13:38,960 --> 00:13:45,790
The more I had seen of the man the more I liked him and the more I admired him and marveled over the mysterious wonders of his profession.

184
00:13:45,790 --> 00:13:51,780
When we parted for the night, I went home with a far happier heart than I had carried with me to his office.

185
00:13:51,780 --> 00:13:52,600
Part Two

186
00:13:52,600 --> 00:13:58,340
Next morning it was in all the newspapers, in the minutest detail.

187
00:13:58,340 --> 00:14:09,180
It even had additions—consisting of Detective This, Detective That, and Detective The Other's “Theory” as to how the robbery was done, who the robbers were, and whither they had flown with their booty.

188
00:14:09,180 --> 00:14:16,630
There were eleven of these theories, and they covered all the possibilities; and this single fact shows what independent thinkers detectives are.

189
00:14:16,630 --> 00:14:27,290
No two theories were alike, or even much resembled each other, save in one striking particular, and in that one all the other eleven theories were absolutely agreed.

190
00:14:27,290 --> 00:14:38,030
That was, that although the rear of my building was torn out and the only door remained locked, the elephant had not been removed through the rent, but by some other (undiscovered) outlet.

191
00:14:38,030 --> 00:14:42,530
All agreed that the robbers had made that rent only to mislead the detectives.

192
00:14:42,530 --> 00:14:49,340
That never would have occurred to me or to any other layman, perhaps, but it had not deceived the detectives for a moment.

193
00:14:49,340 --> 00:14:56,760
Thus, what I had supposed was the only thing that had no mystery about it was in fact the very thing I had gone furthest astray in.

194
00:14:56,760 --> 00:15:04,900
The eleven theories all named the supposed robbers, but no two named the same robbers; the total number of suspected persons was thirty-seven.

195
00:15:04,900 --> 00:15:12,370
The various newspaper accounts all closed with the most important opinion of all—that of Chief Inspector Blunt.

196
00:15:12,370 --> 00:15:19,780
A portion of this statement read as follows: The chief knows who the two principals are, namely, “Brick” Duffy and “Red” McFadden.

197
00:15:19,780 --> 00:15:27,650
Ten days before the robbery was achieved he was already aware that it was to be attempted, and had quietly proceeded to shadow those two noted villains;

198
00:15:27,650 --> 00:15:35,210
but unfortunately on the night in question their track was lost, and before it could be found again the bird was flown—that is, the elephant.

199
00:15:35,210 --> 00:15:45,950
Duffy and McFadden are the boldest scoundrels in the profession; the chief has reasons for believing that they are the men who stole the stove out of the detective headquarters on a bitter night last winter—

200
00:15:45,950 --> 00:15:56,240
in consequence of which the chief and every detective present were in the hands of the physicians before morning, some with frozen feet, others with frozen fingers, ears, and other members.

201
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:02,080
When I read the first half of that I was more astonished than ever at the wonderful sagacity of this strange man.

202
00:16:02,080 --> 00:16:07,610
He not only saw everything in the present with a clear eye, but even the future could not be hidden from him.

203
00:16:07,610 --> 00:16:21,880
I was soon at his office, and said I could not help wishing he had had those men arrested, and so prevented the trouble and loss; but his reply was simple and unanswerable: “It is not our province to prevent crime, but to punish it.

204
00:16:21,880 --> 00:16:25,260
We cannot punish it until it is committed.”

205
00:16:25,260 --> 00:16:39,490
I remarked that the secrecy with which we had begun had been marred by the newspapers; not only all our facts but all our plans and purposes had been revealed; even all the suspected persons had been named; these would doubtless disguise themselves now, or go into hiding.

206
00:16:39,490 --> 00:16:41,230
“Let them.

207
00:16:41,230 --> 00:16:49,010
They will find that when I am ready for them my hand will descend upon them, in their secret places, as unerringly as the hand of fate.

208
00:16:49,010 --> 00:16:52,390
As to the newspapers, we must keep in with them.

209
00:16:52,390 --> 00:16:57,900
Fame, reputation, constant public mention—these are the detective's bread and butter.

210
00:16:57,900 --> 00:17:08,580
He must publish his facts, else he will be supposed to have none; he must publish his theory, for nothing is so strange or striking as a detective's theory, or brings him so much wonderful respect;

211
00:17:08,580 --> 00:17:15,190
we must publish our plans, for these journals insist upon having, and we could not deny them without offending.

212
00:17:15,190 --> 00:17:19,850
We must constantly show the public what we are doing, or they will believe we're doing nothing.

213
00:17:19,850 --> 00:17:32,290
It is much pleasanter to have a newspaper say, 'Inspector Blunt's ingenious and extraordinary theory is as follows,' than to have it say some harsh thing, or, worse still, some sarcastic one.”

214
00:17:32,290 --> 00:17:34,910
“I see the force of what you say.

215
00:17:34,910 --> 00:17:42,150
But I noticed that in one part of your remarks in the papers this morning you refused to reveal your opinion upon a certain minor point.”

216
00:17:42,150 --> 00:17:44,590
“Yes, we always do that; it has a good effect.

217
00:17:44,590 --> 00:17:48,270
Besides, I had not formed any opinion on that point, anyway.”

218
00:17:48,270 --> 00:17:55,460
I deposited a considerable sum of money with the inspector, to meet current expenses, and sat down to wait for news.

219
00:17:55,460 --> 00:17:59,100
We were expecting the telegrams to begin to arrive at any moment now.

220
00:17:59,100 --> 00:18:08,550
Meantime I reread the newspapers and also our descriptive circular, and observed that our twenty-five thousand dollars reward seemed to be offered only to detectives.

221
00:18:08,550 --> 00:18:12,530
I said I thought it ought to be offered to anybody who would catch the elephant.

222
00:18:12,530 --> 00:18:18,880
The inspector said: “It is the detectives who will find the elephant; hence the reward will go to the right place.

223
00:18:18,880 --> 00:18:28,840
If other people found the animal, it would only be by watching the detectives and taking advantage of clues and indications stolen from them, and that would entitle the detectives to the reward, after all.

224
00:18:28,840 --> 00:18:44,170
The proper office of a reward is to stimulate the men who deliver up their time and their trained sagacities to this sort of work, and not to confer benefits upon chance citizens who stumble upon a capture without having earned the benefits by their own merits and labors.”

225
00:18:44,170 --> 00:18:46,950
This was reasonable enough, certainly.

226
00:18:46,950 --> 00:18:53,580
Now the telegraphic machine in the corner began to click, and the following despatch was the result: FLOWER STATION, N.

227
00:18:53,580 --> 00:18:55,180
Y., 7.30 A.M.

228
00:18:55,180 --> 00:18:56,530
Have got a clue.

229
00:18:56,530 --> 00:18:59,870
Found a succession of deep tracks across a farm near here.

230
00:18:59,870 --> 00:19:03,840
Followed them two miles east without result; think elephant went west.

231
00:19:03,840 --> 00:19:05,910
Shall now shadow him in that direction.

232
00:19:05,910 --> 00:19:07,750
DARLEY, Detective.

233
00:19:07,750 --> 00:19:11,160
“Darley's one of the best men on the force,” said the inspector.

234
00:19:11,160 --> 00:19:13,410
“We shall hear from him again before long.”

235
00:19:13,410 --> 00:19:16,570
Telegram No. 2 came: BARKER'S, N.

236
00:19:16,570 --> 00:19:18,860
J., 7.40 A.M.

237
00:19:18,860 --> 00:19:20,150
Just arrived.

238
00:19:20,150 --> 00:19:24,040
Glass factory broken open here during night, and eight hundred bottles taken.

239
00:19:24,040 --> 00:19:27,380
Only water in large quantity near here is five miles distant.

240
00:19:27,380 --> 00:19:28,710
Shall strike for there.

241
00:19:28,710 --> 00:19:30,040
Elephant will be thirsty.

242
00:19:30,040 --> 00:19:31,360
Bottles were empty.

243
00:19:31,360 --> 00:19:33,290
BAKER, Detective.

244
00:19:33,290 --> 00:19:36,000
“That promises well, too,” said the inspector.

245
00:19:36,000 --> 00:19:39,130
“I told you the creature's appetites would not be bad clues.”

246
00:19:39,130 --> 00:19:40,410
Telegram No.

247
00:19:40,410 --> 00:19:42,410
3: TAYLORVILLE, L.

248
00:19:42,410 --> 00:19:42,660
I.

249
00:19:42,660 --> 00:19:44,490
8.15 A.M.

250
00:19:44,490 --> 00:19:47,270
A haystack near here disappeared during night.

251
00:19:47,270 --> 00:19:48,290
Probably eaten.

252
00:19:48,290 --> 00:19:50,140
Have got a clue, and am off.

253
00:19:50,140 --> 00:19:52,270
HUBBARD, Detective.

254
00:19:52,270 --> 00:19:54,680
“How he does move around!”

255
00:19:54,680 --> 00:19:59,610
said the inspector “I knew we had a difficult job on hand, but we shall catch him yet.”

256
00:19:59,610 --> 00:20:00,700
FLOWER STATION, N.

257
00:20:00,700 --> 00:20:02,130
Y., 9 A.M.

258
00:20:02,130 --> 00:20:04,660
Shadowed the tracks three miles westward.

259
00:20:04,660 --> 00:20:06,300
Large, deep, and ragged.

260
00:20:06,300 --> 00:20:09,360
Have just met a farmer who says they are not elephant-tracks.

261
00:20:09,360 --> 00:20:13,810
Says they are holes where he dug up saplings for shade-trees when ground was frozen last winter.

262
00:20:13,810 --> 00:20:15,420
Give me orders how to proceed.

263
00:20:15,420 --> 00:20:17,330
DARLEY, Detective.

264
00:20:17,330 --> 00:20:18,600
“Aha!

265
00:20:18,600 --> 00:20:20,140
a confederate of the thieves!

266
00:20:20,140 --> 00:20:23,470
The thing, grows warm,” said the inspector.

267
00:20:23,470 --> 00:20:29,200
He dictated the following telegram to Darley: Arrest the man and force him to name his pals.

268
00:20:29,200 --> 00:20:31,880
Continue to follow the tracks to the Pacific, if necessary.

269
00:20:31,880 --> 00:20:33,300
Chief BLUNT.

270
00:20:33,300 --> 00:20:39,290
Next telegram: CONEY POINT, PA., 8.45 A.M.

271
00:20:39,290 --> 00:20:43,900
Gas office broken open here during night and three months' unpaid gas bills taken.

272
00:20:43,900 --> 00:20:45,850
Have got a clue and am away.

273
00:20:45,850 --> 00:20:47,700
MURPHY, Detective.

274
00:20:47,700 --> 00:20:48,850
“Heavens!”

275
00:20:48,850 --> 00:20:51,640
said the inspector; “would he eat gas bills?”

276
00:20:51,640 --> 00:20:55,070
“Through ignorance—yes; but they cannot support life.

277
00:20:55,070 --> 00:20:56,490
At least, unassisted.”

278
00:20:56,490 --> 00:21:01,250
Now came this exciting telegram: IRONVILLE, N.

279
00:21:01,250 --> 00:21:03,050
Y., 9.30 A.M.

280
00:21:03,050 --> 00:21:04,340
Just arrived.

281
00:21:04,340 --> 00:21:06,340
This village in consternation.

282
00:21:06,340 --> 00:21:08,850
Elephant passed through here at five this morning.

283
00:21:08,850 --> 00:21:16,260
Some say he went east some say west, some north, some south—but all say they did not wait to notice, particularly.

284
00:21:16,260 --> 00:21:19,380
He killed a horse; have secured a piece of it for a clue.

285
00:21:19,380 --> 00:21:23,840
Killed it with his trunk; from style of blow, think he struck it left-handed.

286
00:21:23,840 --> 00:21:28,680
From position in which horse lies, think elephant traveled northward along line of Berkley Railway.

287
00:21:28,680 --> 00:21:32,600
Has four and a half hours' start, but I move on his track at once.

288
00:21:32,600 --> 00:21:34,300
HAWES, Detective.

289
00:21:34,300 --> 00:21:36,580
I uttered exclamations of joy.

290
00:21:36,580 --> 00:21:39,560
The inspector was as self-contained as a graven image.

291
00:21:39,560 --> 00:21:41,320
He calmly touched his bell.

292
00:21:41,320 --> 00:21:43,660
“Alaric, send Captain Burns here.”

293
00:21:43,660 --> 00:21:45,180
Burns appeared.

294
00:21:45,180 --> 00:21:47,860
“How many men are ready for instant orders?”

295
00:21:47,860 --> 00:21:49,230
“Ninety-six, sir.”

296
00:21:49,230 --> 00:21:50,600
“Send them north at once.

297
00:21:50,600 --> 00:21:54,440
Let them concentrate along the line of the Berkley road north of Ironville.”

298
00:21:54,440 --> 00:21:55,710
“Yes, sir.”

299
00:21:55,710 --> 00:21:58,320
“Let them conduct their movements with the utmost secrecy.

300
00:21:58,320 --> 00:22:01,410
As fast as others are at liberty, hold them for orders.”

301
00:22:01,410 --> 00:22:02,430
“Yes, sir.”

302
00:22:02,430 --> 00:22:03,300
“Go!”

303
00:22:03,300 --> 00:22:04,780
“Yes, sir.”

304
00:22:04,780 --> 00:22:08,350
Presently came another telegram: SAGE CORNERS, N.

305
00:22:08,350 --> 00:22:09,720
Y., 10.30.

306
00:22:09,720 --> 00:22:10,990
Just arrived.

307
00:22:10,990 --> 00:22:13,340
Elephant passed through here at 8.15.

308
00:22:13,340 --> 00:22:15,720
All escaped from the town but a policeman.

309
00:22:15,720 --> 00:22:19,360
Apparently elephant did not strike at policeman, but at the lamp-post.

310
00:22:19,360 --> 00:22:20,310
Got both.

311
00:22:20,310 --> 00:22:22,910
I have secured a portion of the policeman as clue.

312
00:22:22,910 --> 00:22:24,810
STUMM, Detective.

313
00:22:24,810 --> 00:22:28,450
“So the elephant has turned westward,” said the inspector.

314
00:22:28,450 --> 00:22:32,340
“However, he will not escape, for my men are scattered all over that region.”

315
00:22:32,340 --> 00:22:38,550
The next telegram said: GLOVER'S, 11.15 Just arrived.

316
00:22:38,550 --> 00:22:41,280
Village deserted, except sick and aged.

317
00:22:41,280 --> 00:22:43,990
Elephant passed through three-quarters of an hour ago.

318
00:22:43,990 --> 00:22:50,140
The anti-temperance mass-meeting was in session; he put his trunk in at a window and washed it out with water from cistern.

319
00:22:50,140 --> 00:22:52,960
Some swallowed it—since dead; several drowned.

320
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,880
Detectives Cross and O'Shaughnessy were passing through town, but going south—so missed elephant.

321
00:22:57,880 --> 00:23:02,300
Whole region for many miles around in terror—people flying from their homes.

322
00:23:02,300 --> 00:23:05,350
Wherever they turn they meet elephant, and many are killed.

323
00:23:05,350 --> 00:23:07,180
BRANT, Detective.

324
00:23:07,180 --> 00:23:10,910
I could have shed tears, this havoc so distressed me.

325
00:23:10,910 --> 00:23:14,510
But the inspector only said: “You see—we are closing in on him.

326
00:23:14,510 --> 00:23:17,460
He feels our presence; he has turned eastward again.”

327
00:23:17,460 --> 00:23:20,210
Yet further troublous news was in store for us.

328
00:23:20,210 --> 00:23:24,190
The telegraph brought this: HOGANSPORT, 12.19.

329
00:23:24,190 --> 00:23:25,260
Just arrived.

330
00:23:25,260 --> 00:23:29,340
Elephant passed through half an hour ago, creating wildest fright and excitement.

331
00:23:29,340 --> 00:23:33,580
Elephant raged around streets; two plumbers going by, killed one—other escaped.

332
00:23:33,580 --> 00:23:34,620
Regret general.

333
00:23:34,620 --> 00:23:36,440
O'FLAHERTY, Detective.

334
00:23:36,440 --> 00:23:39,560
“Now he is right in the midst of my men,” said the inspector.

335
00:23:39,560 --> 00:23:41,140
“Nothing can save him.”

336
00:23:41,140 --> 00:23:55,280
A succession of telegrams came from detectives who were scattered through New Jersey and Pennsylvania, and who were following clues consisting of ravaged barns, factories, and Sunday-school libraries, with high hopes-hopes amounting to certainties, indeed.

337
00:23:55,280 --> 00:24:00,670
The inspector said: “I wish I could communicate with them and order them north, but that is impossible.

338
00:24:00,670 --> 00:24:07,160
A detective only visits a telegraph office to send his report; then he is off again, and you don't know where to put your hand on him.”

339
00:24:07,160 --> 00:24:11,670
Now came this despatch: BRIDGEPORT, CT., 12.15.

340
00:24:11,670 --> 00:24:19,700
Barnum offers rate of $4,000 a year for exclusive privilege of using elephant as traveling advertising medium from now till detectives find him.

341
00:24:19,700 --> 00:24:21,730
Wants to paste circus-posters on him.

342
00:24:21,730 --> 00:24:23,510
Desires immediate answer.

343
00:24:23,510 --> 00:24:25,050
BOGGS, Detective.

344
00:24:25,050 --> 00:24:27,260
“That is perfectly absurd!”

345
00:24:27,260 --> 00:24:28,420
I exclaimed.

346
00:24:28,420 --> 00:24:30,700
“Of course it is,” said the inspector.

347
00:24:30,700 --> 00:24:35,880
“Evidently Mr. Barnum, who thinks he is so sharp, does not know me—but I know him.”

348
00:24:35,880 --> 00:24:40,830
Then he dictated this answer to the despatch: Mr. Barnum's offer declined.

349
00:24:40,830 --> 00:24:43,160
Make it $7,000 or nothing.

350
00:24:43,160 --> 00:24:44,470
Chief BLUNT.

351
00:24:44,470 --> 00:24:45,460
“There.

352
00:24:45,460 --> 00:24:47,250
We shall not have to wait long for an answer.

353
00:24:47,250 --> 00:24:52,260
Mr. Barnum is not at home; he is in the telegraph office—it is his way when he has business on hand.

354
00:24:52,260 --> 00:24:53,440
Inside of three—”

355
00:24:53,440 --> 00:24:54,250
Done.—P.

356
00:24:54,250 --> 00:24:55,140
T. BARNUM.

357
00:24:55,140 --> 00:24:58,460
So interrupted the clicking telegraphic instrument.

358
00:24:58,460 --> 00:25:06,510
Before I could make a comment upon this extraordinary episode, the following despatch carried my thoughts into another and very distressing channel: BOLIVIA, N.

359
00:25:06,510 --> 00:25:08,100
Y., 12.50.

360
00:25:08,100 --> 00:25:16,110
Elephant arrived here from the south and passed through toward the forest at 11.50, dispersing a funeral on the way, and diminishing the mourners by two.

361
00:25:16,110 --> 00:25:19,300
Citizens fired some small cannon-balls into him, and then fled.

362
00:25:19,300 --> 00:25:29,050
Detective Burke and I arrived ten minutes later, from the north, but mistook some excavations for footprints, and so lost a good deal of time; but at last we struck the right trail and followed it to the woods.

363
00:25:29,050 --> 00:25:34,590
We then got down on our hands and knees and continued to keep a sharp eye on the track, and so shadowed it into the brush.

364
00:25:34,590 --> 00:25:36,020
Burke was in advance.

365
00:25:36,020 --> 00:25:44,880
Unfortunately the animal had stopped to rest; therefore, Burke having his head down, intent upon the track, butted up against the elephant's hind legs before he was aware of his vicinity.

366
00:25:44,880 --> 00:25:55,110
Burke instantly arose to his feet, seized the tail, and exclaimed joyfully, “I claim the re—” but got no further, for a single blow of the huge trunk laid the brave fellow's fragments low in death.

367
00:25:55,110 --> 00:26:06,150
I fled rearward, and the elephant turned and shadowed me to the edge of the wood, making tremendous speed, and I should inevitably have been lost, but that the remains of the funeral providentially intervened again and diverted his attention.

368
00:26:06,150 --> 00:26:12,470
I have just learned that nothing of that funeral is now left; but this is no loss, for there is abundance of material for another.

369
00:26:12,470 --> 00:26:14,890
Meantime, the elephant has disappeared again.

370
00:26:14,890 --> 00:26:16,910
MULROONEY, Detective.

371
00:26:16,910 --> 00:26:32,320
We heard no news except from the diligent and confident detectives scattered about New Jersey, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Virginia—who were all following fresh and encouraging clues—until shortly after 2 P.M., when this telegram came: BAXTER CENTER, 2.15.

372
00:26:32,320 --> 00:26:40,750
Elephant been here, plastered over with circus-bills, and he broke up a revival, striking down and damaging many who were on the point of entering upon a better life.

373
00:26:40,750 --> 00:26:43,290
Citizens penned him up and established a guard.

374
00:26:43,290 --> 00:26:50,550
When Detective Brown and I arrived, some time after, we entered inclosure and proceeded to identify elephant by photograph and description.

375
00:26:50,550 --> 00:26:56,740
All marks tallied exactly except one, which we could not see—the boil-scar under armpit.

376
00:26:56,740 --> 00:27:03,530
To make sure, Brown crept under to look, and was immediately brained—that is, head crushed and destroyed, though nothing issued from debris.

377
00:27:03,530 --> 00:27:07,040
All fled so did elephant, striking right and left with much effect.

378
00:27:07,040 --> 00:27:09,930
Has escaped, but left bold blood-track from cannon-wounds.

379
00:27:09,930 --> 00:27:11,570
Rediscovery certain.

380
00:27:11,570 --> 00:27:13,990
He broke southward, through a dense forest.

381
00:27:13,990 --> 00:27:15,700
BRENT, Detective.

382
00:27:15,700 --> 00:27:17,850
That was the last telegram.

383
00:27:17,850 --> 00:27:23,410
At nightfall a fog shut down which was so dense that objects but three feet away could not be discerned.

384
00:27:23,410 --> 00:27:25,120
This lasted all night.

385
00:27:25,120 --> 00:27:29,100
The ferry-boats and even the omnibuses had to stop running.

386
00:27:29,100 --> 00:27:31,270
Section Three

387
00:27:31,270 --> 00:27:41,040
Next morning the papers were as full of detective theories as before; they had all our tragic facts in detail also, and a great many more which they had received from their telegraphic correspondents.

388
00:27:41,040 --> 00:27:48,380
Column after column was occupied, a third of its way down, with glaring head-lines, which it made my heart sick to read.

389
00:27:48,380 --> 00:27:52,390
Their general tone was like this: The white elephant at large!

390
00:27:52,390 --> 00:27:54,340
He moves upon his fatal march!

391
00:27:54,340 --> 00:27:57,620
Whole villages deserted by their fright-stricken occupants!

392
00:27:57,620 --> 00:28:01,350
Pale terror goes before him, death and devastation follow after!

393
00:28:01,350 --> 00:28:04,280
After these, the detectives!

394
00:28:04,280 --> 00:28:13,290
Barns destroyed, factories gutted, harvests devoured, public assemblages dispersed, accompanied by scenes of carnage impossible to describe!

395
00:28:13,290 --> 00:28:18,000
Theories of thirty-four of the most distinguished detectives on the force!

396
00:28:18,000 --> 00:28:20,210
Theory of Chief Blunt!

397
00:28:20,210 --> 00:28:21,520
“There!”

398
00:28:21,520 --> 00:28:26,880
said Inspector Blunt, almost betrayed into excitement, “this is magnificent!

399
00:28:26,880 --> 00:28:30,770
This is the greatest windfall that any detective organization ever had.

400
00:28:30,770 --> 00:28:36,380
The fame of it will travel to the ends of the earth, and endure to the end of time, and my name with it.”

401
00:28:36,380 --> 00:28:39,240
But there was no joy for me.

402
00:28:39,240 --> 00:28:45,070
I felt as if I had committed all those red crimes, and that the elephant was only my irresponsible agent.

403
00:28:45,070 --> 00:28:46,940
And how the list had grown!

404
00:28:46,940 --> 00:28:51,330
In one place he had “interfered with an election and killed five repeaters.”

405
00:28:51,330 --> 00:29:00,780
He had followed this act with the destruction of two pool fellows, named O'Donohue and McFlannigan, who had “found a refuge in the home of the oppressed of all lands only the day before,

406
00:29:00,780 --> 00:29:10,600
and were in the act of exercising for the first time the noble right of American citizens at the polls, when stricken down by the relentless hand of the Scourge of Siam.”

407
00:29:10,600 --> 00:29:21,240
In another, he had “found a crazy sensation-preacher preparing his next season's heroic attacks on the dance, the theater, and other things which can't strike back, and had stepped on him.”

408
00:29:21,240 --> 00:29:25,500
And in still another place he had “killed a lightning-rod agent.”

409
00:29:25,500 --> 00:29:30,520
And so the list went on, growing redder and redder, and more and more heartbreaking.

410
00:29:30,520 --> 00:29:34,380
Sixty persons had been killed, and two hundred and forty wounded.

411
00:29:34,380 --> 00:29:47,960
All the accounts bore just testimony to the activity and devotion of the detectives, and all closed with the remark that “three hundred thousand citizens and four detectives saw the dread creature, and two of the latter he destroyed.”

412
00:29:47,960 --> 00:29:51,470
I dreaded to hear the telegraphic instrument begin to click again.

413
00:29:51,470 --> 00:29:56,170
By and by the messages began to pour in, but I was happily disappointed in their nature.

414
00:29:56,170 --> 00:30:00,150
It was soon apparent that all trace of the elephant was lost.

415
00:30:00,150 --> 00:30:03,920
The fog had enabled him to search out a good hiding-place unobserved.

416
00:30:03,920 --> 00:30:12,990
Telegrams from the most absurdly distant points reported that a dim vast mass had been glimpsed there through the fog at such and such an hour, and was “undoubtedly the elephant.”

417
00:30:12,990 --> 00:30:22,050
This dim vast mass had been glimpsed in New Haven, in New Jersey, in Pennsylvania, in interior New York, in Brooklyn, and even in the city of New York itself!

418
00:30:22,050 --> 00:30:27,170
But in all cases the dim vast mass had vanished quickly and left no trace.

419
00:30:27,170 --> 00:30:37,910
Every detective of the large force scattered over this huge extent of country sent his hourly report, and each and every one of them had a clue, and was shadowing something, and was hot upon the heels of it.

420
00:30:37,910 --> 00:30:40,830
But the day passed without other result.

421
00:30:40,830 --> 00:30:42,540
The next day the same.

422
00:30:42,540 --> 00:30:44,720
The next just the same.

423
00:30:44,720 --> 00:30:56,000
The newspaper reports began to grow monotonous with facts that amounted to nothing, clues which led to nothing, and theories which had nearly exhausted the elements which surprise and delight and dazzle.

424
00:30:56,000 --> 00:31:00,790
By advice of the inspector I doubled the reward.

425
00:31:00,790 --> 00:31:03,260
Four more dull days followed.

426
00:31:03,260 --> 00:31:11,520
Then came a bitter blow to the poor, hard-working detectives—the journalists declined to print their theories, and coldly said, “Give us a rest.”

427
00:31:11,520 --> 00:31:17,910
Two weeks after the elephant's disappearance I raised the reward to seventy-five thousand dollars by the inspector's advice.

428
00:31:17,910 --> 00:31:25,220
It was a great sum, but I felt that I would rather sacrifice my whole private fortune than lose my credit with my government.

429
00:31:25,220 --> 00:31:32,460
Now that the detectives were in adversity, the newspapers turned upon them, and began to fling the most stinging sarcasms at them.

430
00:31:32,460 --> 00:31:39,300
This gave the minstrels an idea, and they dressed themselves as detectives and hunted the elephant on the stage in the most extravagant way.

431
00:31:39,300 --> 00:31:47,170
The caricaturists made pictures of detectives scanning the country with spy-glasses, while the elephant, at their backs, stole apples out of their pockets.

432
00:31:47,170 --> 00:31:58,060
And they made all sorts of ridiculous pictures of the detective badge—you have seen that badge printed in gold on the back of detective novels no doubt, it is a wide-staring eye, with the legend, “WE NEVER SLEEP.”

433
00:31:58,060 --> 00:32:06,220
When detectives called for a drink, the would-be facetious barkeeper resurrected an obsolete form of expression and said, “Will you have an eye-opener?”

434
00:32:06,220 --> 00:32:09,100
All the air was thick with sarcasms.

435
00:32:09,100 --> 00:32:13,630
But there was one man who moved calm, untouched, unaffected, through it all.

436
00:32:13,630 --> 00:32:17,400
It was that heart of oak, the chief inspector.

437
00:32:17,400 --> 00:32:21,290
His brave eye never drooped, his serene confidence never wavered.

438
00:32:21,290 --> 00:32:26,650
He always said: “Let them rail on; he laughs best who laughs last.”

439
00:32:26,650 --> 00:32:30,270
My admiration for the man grew into a species of worship.

440
00:32:30,270 --> 00:32:32,160
I was at his side always.

441
00:32:32,160 --> 00:32:37,020
His office had become an unpleasant place to me, and now became daily more and more so.

442
00:32:37,020 --> 00:32:42,100
Yet if he could endure it I meant to do so also—at least, as long as I could.

443
00:32:42,100 --> 00:32:46,990
So I came regularly, and stayed—the only outsider who seemed to be capable of it.

444
00:32:46,990 --> 00:32:56,660
Everybody wondered how I could; and often it seemed to me that I must desert, but at such times I looked into that calm and apparently unconscious face, and held my ground.

445
00:32:56,660 --> 00:33:08,870
About three weeks after the elephant's disappearance I was about to say, one morning, that I should have to strike my colors and retire, when the great detective arrested the thought by proposing one more superb and masterly move.

446
00:33:08,870 --> 00:33:11,360
This was to compromise with the robbers.

447
00:33:11,360 --> 00:33:18,680
The fertility of this man's invention exceeded anything I have ever seen, and I have had a wide intercourse with the world's finest minds.

448
00:33:18,680 --> 00:33:24,380
He said he was confident he could compromise for one hundred thousand dollars and recover the elephant.

449
00:33:24,380 --> 00:33:30,590
I said I believed I could scrape the amount together, but what would become of the poor detectives who had worked so faithfully?

450
00:33:30,590 --> 00:33:34,450
He said: “In compromises they always get half.”

451
00:33:34,450 --> 00:33:36,750
This removed my only objection.

452
00:33:36,750 --> 00:33:46,350
So the inspector wrote two notes, in this form: DEAR MADAM,—Your husband can make a large sum of money (and be entirely protected from the law) by making an immediate, appointment with me.

453
00:33:46,350 --> 00:33:47,710
Chief BLUNT.

454
00:33:47,710 --> 00:33:55,500
He sent one of these by his confidential messenger to the “reputed wife” of Brick Duffy, and the other to the reputed wife of Red McFadden.

455
00:33:55,500 --> 00:34:02,720
Within the hour these offensive answers came: You old fool: Brick Duffy's been dead two years.

456
00:34:02,720 --> 00:34:04,210
BRIDGET MAHONEY.

457
00:34:04,210 --> 00:34:08,860
CHIEF BAT,—Red McFadden is hung and in heaven 18 month.

458
00:34:08,860 --> 00:34:11,370
Any Ass but a detective know that.

459
00:34:11,370 --> 00:34:12,680
MARY O'HOOLIGAN.

460
00:34:12,680 --> 00:34:19,010
“I had long suspected these facts,” said the inspector; “this testimony proves the unerring accuracy of my instinct.”

461
00:34:19,010 --> 00:34:22,340
The moment one resource failed him he was ready with another.

462
00:34:22,340 --> 00:34:37,460
He immediately wrote an advertisement for the morning papers, and I kept a copy of it: A.—xwhlv.242 H.T. Tjnd—fz328wmlg. 0zpo,—; 2m!

463
00:34:37,460 --> 00:34:38,520
2m!

464
00:34:38,520 --> 00:34:39,420
m!

465
00:34:39,420 --> 00:34:39,760
ogw.

466
00:34:39,760 --> 00:34:46,390
He said that if the thief was alive this would bring him to the usual rendezvous.

467
00:34:46,390 --> 00:34:53,380
He further explained that the usual rendezvous was a place where all business affairs between detectives and criminals were conducted.

468
00:34:53,380 --> 00:34:56,720
This meeting would take place at twelve the next night.

469
00:34:56,720 --> 00:35:03,570
We could do nothing till then, and I lost no time in getting out of the office, and was grateful indeed for the privilege.

470
00:35:03,570 --> 00:35:14,880
At eleven the next night I brought one hundred thousand dollars in bank-notes and put them into the chief's hands, and shortly afterward he took his leave, with the brave old undimmed confidence in his eye.

471
00:35:14,880 --> 00:35:21,960
An almost intolerable hour dragged to a close; then I heard his welcome tread, and rose gasping and tottered to meet him.

472
00:35:21,960 --> 00:35:25,020
How his fine eyes flamed with triumph!

473
00:35:25,020 --> 00:35:27,240
He said: “We've compromised!

474
00:35:27,240 --> 00:35:29,510
The jokers will sing a different tune tomorrow!

475
00:35:29,510 --> 00:35:30,960
Follow me!”

476
00:35:30,960 --> 00:35:39,370
He took a lighted candle and strode down into the vast vaulted basement where sixty detectives always slept, and where a score were now playing cards to while the time.

477
00:35:39,370 --> 00:35:41,040
I followed close after him.

478
00:35:41,040 --> 00:35:57,700
He walked swiftly down to the dim remote end of the place, and just as I succumbed to the pangs of suffocation and was swooning away he stumbled and fell over the outlying members of a mighty object, and I heard him exclaim as he went down: “Our noble profession is vindicated.

479
00:35:57,700 --> 00:36:00,280
Here is your elephant!”

480
00:36:00,280 --> 00:36:04,340
I was carried to the office above and restored with carbolic acid.

481
00:36:04,340 --> 00:36:10,970
The whole detective force swarmed in, and such another season of triumphant rejoicing ensued as I had never witnessed before.

482
00:36:10,970 --> 00:36:19,110
The reporters were called, baskets of champagne were opened, toasts were drunk, the handshakings and congratulations were continuous and enthusiastic.

483
00:36:19,110 --> 00:36:29,820
Naturally the chief was the hero of the hour, and his happiness was so complete and had been so patiently and worthily and bravely won that it made me happy to see it, though I stood there a homeless beggar,

484
00:36:29,820 --> 00:36:39,370
my priceless charge dead, and my position in my country's service lost to me through what would always seem my fatally careless execution of a great trust.

485
00:36:39,370 --> 00:36:53,450
Many an eloquent eye testified its deep admiration for the chief, and many a detective's voice murmured, “Look at him—just the king of the profession; only give him a clue, it's all he wants, and there ain't anything hid that he can't find.”

486
00:36:53,450 --> 00:37:02,210
The dividing of the fifty thousand dollars made great pleasure; when it was finished the chief made a little speech while he put his share in his pocket, in which he said,

487
00:37:02,210 --> 00:37:09,160
“Enjoy it, boys, for you've earned it; and, more than that, you've earned for the detective profession undying fame.”

488
00:37:09,160 --> 00:37:14,140
A telegram arrived, which read: MONROE, MICH., 10 P.M.

489
00:37:14,140 --> 00:37:17,440
First time I've struck a telegraph office in over three weeks.

490
00:37:17,440 --> 00:37:24,140
Have followed those footprints, horseback, through the woods, a thousand miles to here, and they get stronger and bigger and fresher every day.

491
00:37:24,140 --> 00:37:27,440
Don't worry-inside of another week I'll have the elephant.

492
00:37:27,440 --> 00:37:28,800
This is dead sure.

493
00:37:28,800 --> 00:37:30,660
DARLEY, Detective.

494
00:37:30,660 --> 00:37:39,860
The chief ordered three cheers for “Darley, one of the finest minds on the force,” and then commanded that he be telegraphed to come home and receive his share of the reward.

495
00:37:39,860 --> 00:37:43,400
So ended that marvelous episode of the stolen elephant.

496
00:37:43,400 --> 00:37:48,830
The newspapers were pleasant with praises once more, the next day, with one contemptible exception.

497
00:37:48,830 --> 00:37:51,440
This sheet said, “Great is the detective!

498
00:37:51,440 --> 00:38:04,470
He may be a little slow in finding a little thing like a mislaid elephant he may hunt him all day and sleep with his rotting carcass all night for three weeks, but he will find him at last if he can get the man who mislaid him to show him the place!”

499
00:38:04,470 --> 00:38:07,060
Poor Hassan was lost to me forever.

500
00:38:07,060 --> 00:38:20,470
The cannonshots had wounded him fatally, he had crept to that unfriendly place in the fog, and there, surrounded by his enemies and in constant danger of detection, had wasted away with hunger and suffering till death gave him peace.

501
00:38:20,470 --> 00:38:29,710
The compromise cost me one hundred thousand dollars; my detective expenses were forty-two thousand dollars more; I never applied for a place again under my government;

502
00:38:29,710 --> 00:38:43,240
I'm a ruined man and a wanderer on the earth, but my admiration for that man, whom I believe to be the greatest detective the world has ever produced, remains undimmed to this day, and will so remain unto the end.

503
00:38:43,240 --> 00:38:46,380
